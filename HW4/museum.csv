Bunker (OC 1883),Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"Crackle-ware may have begun as a mistake but it developed into one of the most prized glaze types in China and among Western collectors.

The subject is a pine tree made famous in the Noh play <i>Hagoromo 羽衣</i>, or <i>The Feathered Robe</i>. In it, a goddess known as a <i>tennin 天人</i> is flying over the pine grove at Miho Bay, and becomes captivated by the beautiful scenery. She removes her magical feathered robe to bathe, hanging it on a pine tree, where it is discovered by a fisherman. He refuses to return the robe until she agrees to dance for him. Since she cannot fly back to her home on the moon without it, she agrees. He returns her robe and she dances, while the chorus describes the beauty of the spring scenery and of her robe. In the end, she returns to the heavens.<br>

Utagawa Hiroshige made more than one famous print series inspired by the 53 way stations on the Tōkaidō, the road that linked Edo (Tokyo) with Kyoto. This print refers to one of those stops and was originally part of a <i>harimaze-e 張交絵 </i> print, reproduced above, a type that included multiple small subjects on a single sheet.

Isis priests shaved their heads and early writers describe the branding of foriegn priests.,Gift of Mrs. Joseph Cook,Roman,Imperial period (27 BC–AD 393),"This man’s baldness and the “x” mark on his forehead likely mean that he was a priest of the Egyptian goddess Isis, who was worshiped across the Roman world and was associated with concepts like the cosmos, motherhood, and seafaring. Devotees to Isis underwent special initiation rituals led by priests and were guaranteed an afterlife. By contrast, the afterlife was ambiguous and not assured for Romans outside of these specific cults. This priest was likely wealthy, with the means to commission a marble portrait, though the priesthood of Isis was open to more socioeconomic classes than those of other Roman gods."

Ito Tozan",Bequest of Charles F. and Abigail L. Olney,Japanese,Meiji period (1868–1912),"In 1868, the Japanese Meiji emperor deposed the last Shogun and initiated a series of sweeping political, social, economic, and cultural changes that transformed Japan into a modern, international superpower. As one aspect of these changes, the Meiji government encouraged the growth of a vigorous art industry, the products of which were meant to impress the world with their superior craftsmanship, as well as bring Japan much needed foreign revenue. This bowl is an excellent example of a particular new type of Meiji ceramic art called Satsuma ware. 
<br><br>
Named for a superficial resemblance to an earlier type of ceramic produced in the region of Satsuma on Kyushu Island, Meiji Satsuma wares featured earthenware bodies that were covered with a thick ivory glaze and lavishly decorated with colored enamels and gold. The best examples were painted with extraordinarily fine designs; in some cases, the artists used single-hair brushes and jeweler's glasses to create their delicate images. The clouds of tiny butterflies on the interior of this bowl would have required just such a painstaking technique. The bowl was painted by a Tokyo-based artist named Itô Tôzan, who had initially studied conventional brush painting before becoming a ceramic decorator in the 1880s. His Satsuma wares won prizes at international exhibitions in Paris, Chicago, and Amsterdam in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1917, he was made a member of the prestigious Imperial Art Academy in Tokyo. One of his sons also became a noted ceramic painter. 
<br><br>
The bowl came to Oberlin in a bequest from the important Cleveland collector Charles F. Olney. The Olney bequest included hundreds of Meiji-period Japanese art objects in a wide range of media, including ceramic, enamel, bronze, and ivory. Today, only a fraction of the original Olney collection remains, but the surviving works include examples that represent the outstanding achievements of Meiji art.

In this painting, Moran depicts the ruins of a mansion that had once belonged to the successful merchant and shipbuilder William H. Aspinwall and had burned to the ground some time before 1880. Set ablaze by the sunset, the dark silhouette and gaping amorphous windows of the charred ruins remind the viewer of the destructive, inevitable forces of nature and the fragility of manmade structures. The impending darkness perhaps suggests the transience of human life as well."

Colonial imports such as snuff (a mixture of oils and tobacco) and other luxury products served as status signals, especially for those aspiring to a higher position.

In the sprinkled blue, the finely mottled appearance comes from the simple method of spraying cobalt oxide (CoO) powder of varying granularity on the vessel body through a bamboo tube capped with a gauze filter. Firing it at a high temperature changes the grey-black powder into the familiar cobalt blue."

<BR><BR>
The many red bats that cover the vessel, as if flying in a cloudy sky, symbolize the phrase “blessings as vast as the sky” (<I>hóngfú qítiān</I> 洪福齐天, 洪福齊天), because the words for red and bat are homonyms with the words for vast and blessings. Each bat also carries a lucky object: at the top symbols of the legendary Daoist Eight Immortals and lucky flowers, at the bottom the Eight Buddhist Symbols of Good Fortune, and around the waist bats carry swastikas, ancient Buddhist symbols that in China were homonyms with the word for “myriad” or “ten thousand,” so paired with the bat mean “ten thousand blessings”. 

The other prominent symbol is the repeated roundel with flying male and female phoenixes symbolizing both a happy marriage (<I>fènghuáng yúfēi</I>  凤凰于飞, 鳳凰于飛) and a wish for great blessings and great prosperity, since they are facing a peony (<I>fèngxì mǔdān</I> 凤戏牡丹, 鳳戱牡丹) and therefore connect the king of birds with the king of flowers.

Olney,Chinese,Qing dynasty (1644–1911),"An ancient style of glaze that had a resurgence in the 18th century imperial kilns, “teadust” glazes (<I>cháyèmò</I> 茶叶末, 茶葉末) are named for their mottled, opaque color, like a powdery mist of green, yellow, and brown flakes. Although the material and firing techniques are similar to celadon, some tiny variations create very different effects. First, magnesia (MgO) is added to the high iron glaze, which in the right conditions leads to the formation of pyroxene crystals, giving the glaze its characteristic flaky appearance. The crystals are created by a slight underfiring (i.e. slightly lower temperature) compared to celadon; furthermore, the kiln has a lighter reduction (low oxygen) atmosphere. As so often happens, what may have begun as a firing mistake evolved into a widely admired glaze style."

Six character mark under the glaze on base.,Bequest of Charles F. and Abigail L. Olney,Chinese,Qing dynasty (1644–1911),"A mark on the bottom of this vessel reveals that it was made during the reign of the Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723-1735) of the Qing dynasty. The Qing dynasty (1644- 1911) was founded by Manchus, a non-Chinese ethnic group from northeastern Asia. The Manchu Qing rulers were uneasy about their status in China and waged a vigorous campaign to promote themselves as protectors and patrons of traditional Chinese culture. As part of this campaign, the Qing court supported many areas of artistic production, including ceramics, which reached unparalleled heights of creative and technical excellence, particularly between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
<br><br>
The form of this vessel is often referred to as a moonflask or a pilgrim flask. It derives from earlier metal and leather canteens that were used by the peoples of Central Asia and the Northern Steppes. This flask form first appeared in Chinese pottery during the Tang dynasty (618-907) and became firmly established as a standard ceramic shape during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The luminous green glaze on the flask belongs to the celadon family of glazes, which were first produced in southern China sometime around the ninth or tenth century. They were created by adding iron oxide to a standard glaze and firing it in a reduced-oxygen kiln. Depending on the relative amounts of iron oxide and oxygen present, the celadon glaze could produce a wide range of colors on the green-blue spectrum. By thus referring to both a traditional form and a traditional glaze, this flask supported the Qing government's efforts to identify itself with previous Chinese dynasties. The subtle decoration on the flask's surface further advanced the image of the Qing court as a place of great sensitivity and aesthetic refinement. 
<br><br>
This flask was part of the bequest that came to Oberlin College in 1904 from Cleveland resident Charles F. Olney. An educator originally from upstate New York, Olney married well and formed an extensive art collection during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1893, he opened the first public art museum in the city of Cleveland. But when the city declined to accept his collection as the basis for a civic museum, Olney bequeathed it to Oberlin College, where it inspired the founding of the AMAM. Most of the Asian artworks collected by Olney were mere curiosities; this flask, however, is an exception and ranks as one of the most important objects in the entire Olney bequest.

On stylistic grounds, this vase can be dated to the mid to late Edo period, suggesting that it may have been made by Nakao Munesada himself. Metalwork signed Nakao Munesada was among the earliest exported to the West in the late 19th century.

Along with 71 other Southern Plains warriors and leaders, he was imprisoned in Fort Marion, Florida, in the late 1870s. Using available paper, often the lined ledgers used for accounting, Plainsmen drew images of their battles and horse raids in much the same manner they had done previously on buffalo hide, lodge covers, tipi liners, and robes. These previous works were often collective pieces of multiple authorship. The practice persisted with the switch to paper, though it became more difficult and less common under exile and reservation life. Howling Wolf’s own drawings were likely sold to tourists in St. Augustine, Florida. Today his work serves as an expressive eyewitness account of his and his tribe’s experiences leading up to and during the forced reservation period caused by United States settler-colonialism ideology."

A total of fifty seven powerful images, all probably made between 1874 and 1875, comprise the gift the AMAM received in 1904. Because they were made on lined ledger paper used by accountants, drawings of this type are called ledger drawings. Howling Wolf drew a variety of historic scenes that often occurred as long as ten years or more before their depiction, and the drawings in the ledger are not in chronological order. The history, meaning, and importance of Oberlin's ledger drawings have been fully described by scholar Joyce M. Szabo. 
<br><br>
Among the individuals shown in these drawings are Howling Wolf himself; his father, Eagle Head, a Southern Cheyenne Council chief and respected warrior; and Sitting Bull, the prominent Sioux leader and medicine man. The drawings' attribution to Howling Wolf is made both on stylistic grounds-in particular the characteristic rendering of horses, a tendency toward foreshortening, and the vividly colorful immediacy of execution, all of which appear in known works by the artist-and because of the inclusion of his name sign: a wolf with lines extending from its open mouth, suggesting sound.
<br><br>
 <I>At the Sand Creek Massacre</I> records an 1864 event in which a Colorado volunteer militia attacked a village of Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho people while they were sleeping. The soldiers are drawn along the left edge of the paper, lined up vertically and firing their weapons as the Cheyenne ride furiously toward them across the center of the sheet. Howling Wolf was a young warrior at the time, and his name sign appears at the top of the page.
<br><br>
Howling Wolf's drawings of the Southern Cheyenne people's attempt to preserve their land and way of life comprise a fascinating visual record. They illustrate Howling Wolf's retrospective interpretation of his life before his exile to Florida. While he and the other warriors were imprisoned, their families at home were forced to live on reservations. After his release in April 1878, he returned to a very different-and dispiriting-life on the reservation, and he apparently made almost no further drawings. Following his father's death in 1881, Howling Wolf became a strong advocate and spokesman for the rights of the Cheyenne. He died in an automobile accident in 1927. 
<br><br>
Howling Wolf's ledger drawings were given to Oberlin College in 1904 by Helen Finney Cox (OC 1846), daughter of Oberlin College's second president, Charles Grandison Finney. The drawings had come to her through her son-in-law, whose father, John Pope, was commander of the Department of the Missouri from 1866 through 1883.

In this drawing, a fleet of Southern Cheyenne warriors led by Howling Wolf himself pursue a white soldier near Fort Wallace in western Kansas. One of a series of drawings made by Howling Wolf, this scene highlights the volatility of American land ownership in the wake of settler colonialism. Although this battle scene shows the Cheyenne warriors victorious, not all of Howling Wolf’s drawings are so hopeful. Many are dominated by violence, gore, and defeat, presaging the tragic fate of the Cheyenne, who were eventually forced onto reservations by the American government.<br>

The drawing’s visual properties—its flatness, vibrancy of hue, and energetic lines—insinuate an active and expansive landscape, one that is deeply familiar to the artist. The American flag, while traditionally understood as a symbol of national unity, here functions as a physical and metaphorical barricade, separating the white settlers enclosed within Fort Wallace from the Cheyenne people on whose land the fort stands. As if to challenge this nebulous symbol, Howling Wolf’s name glyph hovers like an apparition over his head, snarling at the flag."

Cox,Southern Cheyenne,,"The nineteenth-century Plains Indian artist Howling Wolf documented the life of his Southern Cheyenne people through colorful and detailed drawings. A total of fifty seven powerful images, all probably made between 1874 and 1875, comprise the gift the AMAM received in 1904. Because they were made on lined ledger paper used by accountants, drawings of this type are called ledger drawings. Howling Wolf drew a variety of historic scenes that often occurred as long as ten years or more before their depiction, and the drawings in the ledger are not in chronological order. The history, meaning, and importance of Oberlin's ledger drawings have been fully described by scholar Joyce M. Szabo. 
<br><br>
Among the individuals shown in these drawings are Howling Wolf himself; his father, Eagle Head, a Southern Cheyenne Council chief and respected warrior; and Sitting Bull, the prominent Sioux leader and medicine man. The drawings' attribution to Howling Wolf is made both on stylistic grounds-in particular the characteristic rendering of horses, a tendency toward foreshortening, and the vividly colorful immediacy of execution, all of which appear in known works by the artist-and because of the inclusion of his name sign: a wolf with lines extending from its open mouth, suggesting sound.
<br><br>
<I>Entry into the Medicine Lodge</I> shows Howling Wolf as a specially honored warrior coming into the sacred lodge on horseback, while other warriors fire at an effigy hanging from the center pole. The Sun Dance ceremony in which they are taking part was an annual life-renewal rite for many Plains tribes; the drawing shows the Sun Dance that took place in summer 1874, Howling Wolf's last before being confined at Fort Marion, Florida, for three years with his father and seventy other captive war leaders. 
<br><br>
Howling Wolf's drawings of the Southern Cheyenne people's attempt to preserve their land and way of life comprise a fascinating visual record. They illustrate Howling Wolf's retrospective interpretation of his life before his exile to Florida. While he and the other warriors were imprisoned, their families at home were forced to live on reservations. After his release in April 1878, he returned to a very different-and dispiriting-life on the reservation, and he apparently made almost no further drawings. Following his father's death in 1881, Howling Wolf became a strong advocate and spokesman for the rights of the Cheyenne. He died in an automobile accident in 1927. 
<br><br>
Howling Wolf's ledger drawings were given to Oberlin College in 1904 by Helen Finney Cox (OC 1846), daughter of Oberlin College's second president, Charles Grandison Finney. The drawings had come to her through her son-in-law, whose father, John Pope, was commander of the Department of the Missouri from 1866 through 1883. General Pope, whose headquarters was at Fort Leavenworth, may have acquired the ledger drawings when Howling Wolf and the other prisoners from the Southern Plains wars passed through during their enforced journey to Fort Marion in 1875.

Frame: 38 3/8 × 45 1/4 × 4 3/4 in. (97.5 × 114.9 × 12.1 cm)",,Bequest of Charles F. and Abigail L. Olney,American,,"Recognized as the leading American landscape painter of the first half of the nineteenth century, Thomas Cole celebrated the uniqueness of the native American landscape, which was critical for the development of the Hudson River School. His expressive landscapes, often imbued with religious overtones and the sublime, showed the influence of his British predecessors J. M. W. Turner and John Martin. Among Cole's followers were Asher B. Durand (1796-1886) and his student Frederic Edwin Church (1826- 1900), whose work in the 1850s and '60s as part of the second generation of the Hudson River School is characterized by direct observation of nature. 
<br><br>
<I>Lake with Dead Trees (Catskill)</I> is based on sketches Cole made in late summer 1825 with support from his patron, New York merchant George Washington Bruen. The twenty-four-year-old artist traveled by steamboat up the Hudson River, disembarking at West Point and Catskill, New York. The drawings Cole made on this trip served as the basis for a powerful group of new landscape paintings. A pencil drawing (now at the Detroit Institute of Arts) made at this time is inscribed ""Lake of Dead Trees"" and depicts the general composition of the AMAM painting with light and color notations. In the present work, Cole amplifies the story and enhances the wilderness aspect of the Catskill landscape-dead trees appear in the left foreground along with two fleeing deer and the setting sun in the right distance. These details support many varied literary, religious, or other symbolic readings of the picture and anticipate Cole's later allegorical landscapes. 
<br><br>
The Oberlin painting is one of three by Cole that were shown in the window of William Coleman's New York shop in late October or early November 1825. The landscapes captured the attention of artist and president of the American Academy of Fine Arts Colonel John Trumbull (1756- 1843), who purchased one of the paintings (<I>Kaaterskill Upper Fall, Catskill Mountains</I>, location unknown). Trumbull was so impressed with Cole's work that he called them to the attention of writer and artist William Dunlap (1766-1839), who bought the AMAM painting, and to artist Asher B. Durand, who purchased <I>View of Fort Putnam</I> (Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia). 
<br><br>
The story of Trumbull's enthusiastic reaction to Cole's three landscapes quickly achieved legendary status. The <I>New York Evening Post</I> extensively described this discovery and famously quoted Trumbull as saying to William Coleman, ""What I now purchase for 25 dollars I would not part for 25 guineas. I am delighted, and at the same time mortified. This youth has done at once, and without instruction, what I can not do after fifty years practice"" (<I>New York Evening Post</I>, November 22, 1825). Shortly after Trumbull, Dunlap, and Durand acquired Cole's paintings, they were exhibited together at the New York Academy of Fine Arts.
<br><br>
Marking a significant moment in American art history, these early sales launched Cole's career as a landscape painter and led the way to important future commissions. <I>Lake with Dead Trees</I> was donated to Oberlin College in 1904 by Cleveland educator Charles F. Olney and was first exhibited in the town's Carnegie library, more than ten years before a museum was built for the College.

Cropsey believed landscapes were the highest art form, as only nature could fully capture the glory of God.

<br>
The title, One Hundred Accumulations of Immortal Garments (百曡僊衣 Bǎidié Xiānyī ), is both poetic and rooted in the traditional Chinese vocabulary of auspicious visual puns. In the word for butterfly, húdié 蝴蝶, the first character sounds like blessings (fú 福) and riches (fù 富), and the second character sounds like both accumulation (dié 曡) and the age of seventy to eighty (dié 耋), implying a wish for longevity. The title therefore plays on the idea that the colors of the flowers and butterfly wings are as resplendent as the clothing of the Chinese deities called immortals (xiān 僊 or 仙); however, because of the pun on the words accumulation and butterfly, the title also suggests 100 butterflies.

Freer (1854-1919), was dispersing the portions of his collection that had not already been donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and giving them to other museums and academic institutions around the country. King quickly wrote to Freer and requested a donation for Oberlin College. Lengthy negotiations ensued, and, in 1912, Freer sent Oberlin a gift of one hundred Chinese and Japanese paintings, ceramics, and sculptures that he hoped would, in his words, ""aid some of your students to a better knowledge of the Far East."" This scroll painting was one of the most important works of art in that gift. 
<br><br>
The painting depicts a number of archetypal female figures standing and sitting in a landscape setting. The elegant character in the upper right corner is identifiable by her clothing and hairstyle as a consort of the Shogun, and is accompanied by a welldressed maid. In contrast to this aristocratic pair, the woman in the lower right corner is a humble commoner who is portrayed wearing simple clothes and lighting a pipe. The group of women in the center of the picture includes a high-ranking courtesan and her two attendants. Immediately to their left is a group of townswomen whose clothes suggest different levels of wealth and marital status. Finally, in the left background are three rustic women who are also of different ages and social status. What ostensibly unites this fanciful parade of women whose paths would never cross in real life is the ""festival of pulling the young pines"" (<I>komatsu-hiki</I>). This ancient festival involved women going out into the countryside on a specified day shortly after the lunar New Year and collecting pine saplings to celebrate the rejuvenation and fertility of spring. Although this festival had occasionally been depicted in earlier Japanese painting, it was not a common subject and this representation of it with so many different types of contemporary women is especially unusual. 
<br><br>
This scroll is an example of the Japanese genre <I>ukiyo-e</I>, literally ""Pictures of the Floating World."" <I>Ukiyo-e</I> encompasses a large body of paintings and prints that depict the characters, places, and activities associated with Japanese leisure culture as it evolved between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. Teisai Hokuba was one of the best <I>ukiyo-e</I> painters of the nineteenth century. Born into a samurai family, Hokuba was a student of the great master Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). In addition to painting, he also designed woodblock prints and book illustrations. This painting belongs to the last phase of Hokuba's career, around 1830 to 1844, when his creative imagination and technical skills were at their highest. The scroll would likely have been specially commissioned and was probably quite expensive. At the time it was painted, it must have been a family treasure. But for reasons unknown, it was sold in the late nineteenth century and eventually ended up in Oberlin, where its frequent use by faculty and students continues to fulfill the hopes of its donor.

Born into a samurai family in Edo (today Tokyo), he began to study painting in the orthodox Kanō school 狩野派, but later gravitated to a style based on Chinese literati painting, known in Japan as <I>bunjinga</I> 文人画 or <I>nanga</I> 南画, for which he became quite famous. 
<BR><BR>
Originating much earlier among elite scholars in China but gaining popularity in Japan in the 18th century, <I>bunjinga</I> rejected showy technical skills and bright colors for simple, casual-seeming ink brushwork with an emphasis on self-expression. In this image we see an idealized China, with dramatic peaks, misty atmosphere, and a solitary figure.

A small bamboo bush is behind the rock, its reaching branches seeming to mirror the gibbon’s arms. All of this is rendered with an elegant simplicity: the brush strokes are minimal, but each is deftly applied to represent soft fur, rough rocky surface, or delicate leaves. This abbreviated style, originating in China, was associated in Japan with Zen Buddhism, as was the subject of a gibbon.<br>
<br>
In Zen texts, the moon was often a metaphor for an enlightenment experience, and practitioners were encouraged to focus on the moon itself, and not the finger pointing at it, the finger symbolizing words that were only guides toward the experience. A gibbon shown reaching for the moon’s reflection in water often signified someone of limited understanding. Here, although the moon is nowhere visible, the gibbon stares into the water but reaches skyward. Is he poised somewhere between ignorance and realization?<br>

Kano Yasunobu was from the next generation of Kano school painters after Kano Sanraku, whose work is behind you. He became the head of the Kyoto branch of the school in 1623. The signature is his formal title and art name, Hōgen Eishin 法眼永真."

Freer,Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"Originally a leaf from an album, this painting shows a small village or compound nestled among plants and trees by a river bend, as a nearby waterfall descends below a rocky outcropping. It is an excellent example of the type of literati-style painting popular at the imperial court in the early 18th century. The restlessness and dramatic, tectonic forms may reflect influences from Yuan dynasty master Wáng Méng 王蒙 (ca. 1308–1385), whose works the artist had studied in the 1660s.<br>
<br>
Wáng Huī grew up in a family of painters and was discovered as a child prodigy. He became a pupil of Wáng Jiàn 王鉴 / 王鑑 (ca. 1598–1677) and subsequently of Wáng Shímǐn王时敏 / 王時敏 (1592–1680), both of whom were prominent painters of the Orthodox School. Wáng Huī began with emulation of the expressive brushwork of the late Yuan masters, as well as the more descriptive one of the Song landscape masters. But he soon began to explore his own transformation of all the ancient styles and to search for a “Great Synthesis.” Wáng Huī was recognized as one of a respected group known as the “Four Wangs,” together with Wáng Jiàn, Wáng Shímǐn, and Wáng Yuánqí 王原祁 (1642–1715).<br>

During prayer, the arch design on the top of the field is oriented toward the Ka’ba in Mecca, Islam’s holiest site and the focal point for daily prayers. The arch on the rug echoes the <I>mihrab</I>, an arched niche in mosques that indicates the direction of Mecca.

Stellate forms in main border.,Charles Martin Hall  Bequest (OC 1885),Ladik,Ottoman Empire (ca. 1299–1922),"The Koran requires Muslims to pray five times a day in a clean place facing the holy city of Mecca. Ideally, Muslims are supposed to pray in a mosque, but if that is not possible, the prayers may be performed on one's own in the local surroundings. Many Muslims in Western and Central Asia historically performed these private prayer sessions on a special type of woven rug that featured an arch-shaped motif at one end. This arch represents the mihrab, the niche in the mosque wall that orients worshippers toward Mecca. By using these special prayer rugs, faithful Muslims were able to satisfy the Koranic requirements by creating a clean space that was always symbolically pointed in the direction of Mecca.
<br><br>
Prayer rugs were woven across the Islamic world in many different regional variations. This rug was produced in the Turkish village of Ladik, located in central Turkey not far from the town of Konya, a major weaving center from as early as the fourteenth century. Ladik rugs often feature stylized images of tulips, the emblematic flower of the Ottoman Turks who ruled Turkey between the sixteenth and early twentieth centuries. These rugs are also known for the clarity and brilliance of their red and yellow dyes, both of which are used to great effect in this rug. 
<br><br>
The rug is one of fifty eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Islamic rugs that were donated to Oberlin College in 1915 by alumnus Charles Martin Hall (OC 1885). A native of Ohio, Hall was a gifted student who became fascinated with chemistry and engineering while at Oberlin. Shortly after graduating, Hall discovered an inexpensive method of producing aluminum and went on to make a fortune in the metals industry. He later became one of the College's most important benefactors.

During the opening ceremonies for the Suez Canal in November 1869, it decorated the Gezirah Palace, constructed for the event by Isma’il Pasha (1830-95), the Khedive (viceroy) of Egypt and Sudan. Because France was the major sponsor of the canal project, an important guest at the ceremony was the Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III of France. Later, the Shah presented the rug to the Empress, and it remained in her possession until the fall of the French Empire, when her belongings were sold at auction in Paris.<BR>
<BR>
The rug was made in fine silk saturated with ivory, gold, and red. The brilliant colors not only create a translucent luster on the rug, but also symbolize the wealth and power of the owner. The fabric uses the Ghiordes knot, or Turkish knot, that brings both tuft ends together to the surface between two warp yarns, providing a strong consistency and symmetry to the carpet.<BR>

The composition of intertwined, symmetrical floral patterns—a combination of stylized peony and palmette motifs—delivers a visual effect of infinity. The patterns also highlight a large cartouche in the central medallion and eight border cartouches that frame Persian inscriptions, lines from selected odes of Persia’s beloved poet, Sa’di Shirazi (1210–ca. 1291–2).

After that, Harpignies falls somewhere between the Barbizon School and the Impressionists, with his artistic career spanning both movements. Although he did produce some still-lifes and figurative works, his primary interest was the rural and urban landscape. In this late landscape, there is clear evidence of all of the major influences in the artist's career - the feathery trees and foliage of Corot, clouds of Constable, the rich, earthy palette of the Barbizon painters, and the beginnings of Impressionist light.

In this vase, dragons rise dramatically and sinuously from a raging, rocky sea. Considered the highest yang creature in yin-yang symbolism, the dragon came to represent the power and majesty of the emperor, who embodied the highest yang among humanity. Images of dragons with five claws were officially reserved for the imperial family while four- or three-clawed dragons were permitted for lower-ranking nobles and officials, a rule adhered to in ceramics made for the court but less stringently in wares made for the marketplace. In this example, the dragons have four claws, but note that one upraised leg has only three, perhaps a slip of the decorator. Both dragons reach out to grasp the flaming pearl, a symbol interpreted variously as the yang essence, the Buddhist “wish-fulfilling jewel,” thunder, or even the moon.

<br>
<i>Famille Verte</i>, French for green family, was a term applied by Western collectors to Chinese polychrome porcelains from the Kangxi period (1661–1722) that often used a variety of greens.

<br>
Dòucǎi porcelain was popular both domestically and in the Western market. When Chinese ceramic production was halted in the 17th century due to political turbulence with the fall of the Ming dynasty, Western traders turned to Japanese makers, who added rich reds and gold highlights to the glaze. Made in Arita but exported at the port of Imari, these ceramics came to be known in the West as Imari ware. When Chinese production resumed in the late 17th century, Chinese artists began to produce their own interpretations of the popular Imari ware, the best of which, like this example, date to the Kangxi period (1661–1722)."

Achieving this red color can be elusive and very challenging. Copper oxide (cupric oxide, CuO) in the glaze, when fired in a reducing (low oxygen) kiln atmosphere, changes its molecular composition as the oxygen is sucked out to feed the fire. This leaves behind cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and/or colloidal copper, and these tiny metal particles help to refract the light in the glaze and create the distinctive red. The glaze must be of a certain thickness to turn this color, and because the glaze becomes thinner around the rim as the glaze melts and creeps down the vessel, the rim stays white.

Augustus Healy,French,,"Fantin-Latour holds a unique place in the history of 19th-century French painting. His reputation was secured in France by a few large group portraits of members of Parisian artistic and literary circles. However, his popularity and commercial success were established outside France and primarily in England with his still-lifes and flower pieces that he produced throughout his long painting career. By the 1870s, Fantin-Latour had given up portraiture and concentrated on still-lifes and his newly found passion for literary themes. After discovering the music of the contemporary German composer Schumann, Brahms, and Wagner, he began drawing and painting images and scenes from their compositions. These fascinating pictorial adaptations of Romantic scores dominated the final years of the artist's output. <i>The Traveler</i> is likely an example of one of these depictions."

(22.2 × 19.1 cm),Partially glazed in heavy dark brown; globular base with flaring lip; decorated with three-band wave pattern; cover missing.,Gift of Lillian S. Ludlow,Korean,Silla Kingdom (57 BC - 668 AD),"This jar was created in the state of Silla along the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula sometime between the sixth and seventh centuries. The form derives from Han-dynasty Chinese models and was probably used for storing rice or other grains. Its bulbous body made it easier to pour or scoop out its contents, while its long neck offered protection from rodents and insects. Its mouth may originally have been covered by a ceramic, wood, or textile cover. The body of the jar is made from coarse, gray clay and was shaped on a potter's wheel. Potters' wheels were first used in Korea by craftsmen in the Kaya confederacy in the southeastern corner of the Korean peninsula. In the middle of the sixth century, the Kaya confederacy was absorbed by the larger state of Silla to the north, and Silla potters used Kaya technologies to produce high-quality ceramics from the late sixth century onward. Kaya and Silla ceramics are historically important because the state of Silla went on to unify the entire Korean peninsula in the late seventh century, and its culture became the foundation for many later Korean dynasties.
<br><br>
Although jars like this were undoubtedly used in private homes, this one was almost certainly preserved in a tomb. Like the Chinese, the Silla Koreans often buried their dead with offerings of food and objects they would need in the spirit world. The AMAM has a small but good collection of Silla ceramics given in 1920 by Lillian Ludlow of Cleveland. Ludlow had acquired her collection from a relative who worked as a missionary in Korea, and she donated it to Oberlin in recognition of her family's close relationship with Dudley Peter Allen, the Oberlin alumnus after whom the museum is named.

Christ’s sorrowful yet serene face is portrayed through one unbroken, non-intersecting, and spiraling line that originates from the tip of his nose.

Mellan’s image was based on the legend of Veronica’s Veil, a cloth offered to Christ on the way to his crucifixion that was left with the imprint of his face. This miraculously produced cloth became a Christian relic that many artists attempted to replicate.<br>
<br>
 At the bottom of this print, the inscription reads <i>FORMATUR UNICUS UNA</i> (the one and only made from the one and only) and <i>NON ALTER</i> (that cannot be imitated). There is a heretical parallel between the singularity of Christ and the uniqueness of Mellan’s artistry. Through intricate engraving techniques, Mellan announces the superiority of his skills, the singularity of his work, and the legitimacy of his art as the true image of God. His ambition lies further in challenging the limit between the holy and human creation."

The pair of fish also appears in Buddhist symbolism, where they represent freedom of movement and the capacity to thrive in an ocean of suffering. Surrounding those motifs are five stylized bats. The word bat (<i>fú</i>  蝠) is pronounced identically to the word for blessing (<i>fú</i>  福), so five bats symbolize the Five Blessings: old age, wealth, health, love of virtue, and a peaceful death. Surrounding all is a border pattern of angular, intertwining ornament, punctuated by stylized dragon’s-head elements, in an archaistic style that was extremely popular in the mid to late 18th century."

The plot includes an amorous bandit leader, a heroic general, a clever maid, and much romantic pining, concluding with the couple’s happy marriage after Zhang Sheng passes the arduous imperial civil service examination. Traditionally considered scandalous for including a scene of an out of wedlock romantic tryst, the play is often understood as supporting marriage for love, and as a critique of arranged marriages."

Its vocabulary of mountains, rocks, water, trees, and buildings seems dashed off in a cursory manner, the mountains given texture with quivering lines, the trees and buildings rendered with a childlike simplicity. However, each brushstroke has both “ancestry and a lord,” a pedigree of stylistic and historic associations for each stroke and dot that an educated viewer could decode immediately.<br>
<br>
The many red collectors’ seals attest to the painting’s history; its final owner was the most important early patron of the AMAM, Elizabeth Severance Allen Prentiss. The few works of Asian art she donated to the museum were, like this one, out of the mainstream for most American collectors of her era. Wide appreciation for literati painting was not to come until decades later.

This sword has a religious dimension. The small Arabic calligraphic glyph on the blade just above the hilt reads, “In the name of the Lord of Jinn and Humans,” a title for God. The inscription in gold near the end of the blade is a line from a sonnet in Urdu by the poet Mir Anees (1803–1873): “Seeing the son of Haider with a drawn sword in his hand.” The text refers to Husayn, who is revered in Shia Islam as the Third Imam, or leader of Islam after Muhammad.

The bottom band shows the eight trigrams (bagua).",Gift of Dr. Hsiang H. Kung (OC 1906),Chinese,,"This large, bronze Chinese temple bell, with an impressive double-dragon crown and many inscriptions, was donated to Oberlin College in 1929 by alumnus Dr. H. H. Kung (<i>.Kǒng Xiángxī</i> 孔祥熙, 1881–1967, OC 1906). A pivotal and controversial figure in China during the early 20th century, Kung occupied several important ministerial posts in the government of the Republic of China. He was also a successful banker, amassing one of the largest fortunes in China at the time. His wife was equally famous; Soong Ai-ling (<i>Sòng Aǐlíng</i> 宋藹齡, 1888–1973) was the eldest of the three Soong sisters, all central figures in Chinese politics of the era. The bell arrived at Oberlin in 1929, and several plans to create a tower for the bell and ring it at ceremonial occasions did not come to fruition. The bell was accessioned into the museum collection in 1933. <br><br>
Temple bells like this are used to call people to prayer or to punctuate certain rituals. They are rung by striking the exterior surface with a long beam that is hung horizontally and swung. Inscriptions on the bell assert that it was made for the Pavilion of Great Mercy (<i>Dàcígé</i>  大慈閣) in the 15th year of the Dàoguāng reign period (1835) by Yán Jǐntài 颜錦泰, whose workshop was located north of the Wǔlín Gate in the city of Hangzhou in Southern China. “Great Mercy” refers to a Buddhist deity, the bodhisattva Guānyīn (观音 / 觀音), one of the most popular and multifaceted deities in Asia. Guānyīn typically appears in female form in China and is often invoked as a protector of women and children. About a third of the donors listed on the bell’s inscription are women. <br><br>
Recent research by Yuqing Tao (OC 2022) has called into question the dating of the bell. One clue comes from the Buddhist poem written in four vertical columns on the upper register of the bell. It reads, “[May] the Nation’s Foundations be Forever Firm” (國基永固), the People’s Endeavors Prosper Greatly (民業遐昌), Buddhism Wax Daily More Brilliant (佛日增輝), [and] the Wheel of the Dharma Always Turn (法輪常轉).” This is a poem about the relationship of the state to Buddhism and has a long history in China. However, in the original form of the poem the “Nation’s Foundations” was replaced with “the Emperor’s Territory,” and the “People’s Endeavors” replaced with “the Path of the Emperor.” In 1835, China was still ruled by an emperor of the Qing dynasty, so the original wording would be expected. The version of the text on the bell is more consistent with the early 20th century, after the 1911 Revolution deposed the last Qing emperor. Furthermore, there is a record of a bronze maker named Yán Jǐntài with a workshop near the Wǔlín Gate in Hangzhou, but it dates to 1921, when he was hired by the government to make a large, but unspecified, religious object. The existence of a man with the same name and same job working in the same location 86 years earlier is implausible. Finally, Tao’s extensive search of the National Library of China’s digitized database of local records, or gazeteers, did not discover any record of a Pavilion of Great Mercy in Hangzhou as the name of a monastery or temple building. A 1982 article by Maylon H. Hepp (OC '34) in Oberlin's Alumni Magazine notes that, in a 1927 letter from H. H. Kung to Oberlin President Henry Churchill King, Kung wrote that he was having a new bell cast for Oberlin, but a year later reported that he had found an old bell from a temple in Hangzhou, and had shipped this bell to Oberlin. Many questions remain, and research on the bell is ongoing."

Proudhon expressed the dichotomous view of women’s roles this way: “Either housewife or harlot, there is no middle ground.”<<br>>

The plains bison have always been the cornerstone species for the culture, spirituality, and diet of all Great Plains peoples. An equally important animal for the Lakota, a Great Plains tribe, is the horse. The arrival of horses after 1500 revolutionized indigenous cultures and subsistence practices. Hunting became more important as tribes expanded their ranges. As contact with distant tribes occurred more frequently, there was increased likelihood of competition and warfare. Eventually, in most tribes, a person’s wealth or status was measured in horses, and great honors came to those who could capture them from an enemy."

This process is reflected in the AMAM’s sculpture, which is made in terracotta that is painted to look as if it were bronze. Other related sculptures of the <i/>Shoeshine Boy<i/> are made with painted plaster and with bronze. <br>

During the years following her training in the Netherlands, Bloch focused on creating marvelous glass works, several of which she exhibited in a one-woman show in New York City in 1931. Upon seeing her glass sculptures at this exhibition, an impressed Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) invited Bloch to teach at his architectural school at Taliesin East. While Bloch’s talents as an artist were recognized during her lifetime, she is still best known for her friendship with noted Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (1886–1957), who is the subject of this lithograph. Bloch assisted Rivera with his murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts and New York City’s Rockefeller Center, and it was Bloch who succeeded in sneaking photographs of the mural <i>Man at the Crossroads</i> before it was finally destroyed in 1934 due to its anti-capitalist imagery. Today, Bloch’s pictures of Rivera’s mural are the sole visual record of the ill-fated painting."

Norton",Chinese,"Qing Dynasty, Qianlong period (1736 - 1796)","Like other works made for the imperial court, this magnificent vase is not only a visual and technical tour de force, but also proclaims a subtle political message. Made during the reign of the Qianlong emperor (乾隆, reigned 1735–96) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the vase recalls the earlier golden age of underglaze blue decoration during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), a connection that suggested legitimate imperial continuity by the Qing. 
<BR><BR>
Ming decorative motifs include the white-capped waves at the top, the ascending plantain leaves on the neck, the three bands of scrolling lotus flowers and vines, the <I>rúyìtóu</I> (如意头, 如意頭) pattern of hanging volutes on the shoulder, and the upraised lotus-petal pattern at the bottom (a motif borrowed from Buddhist art). A further nod to the Ming era is seen in the dark blue splotches that appear in the decorations. In Ming underglaze blue, the less pure cobalt often melted and ran slightly during the high-temperature firing, pooling in areas to create the dark spots and fuzzy edges known as “heaping and piling.” Although this technical challenge had been overcome by the Qing period, the effect was consciously imitated by the imperial artisans.

(5.1 × 11.7 cm),"Black stoneware with black glaze showing the ""hare's fur"" marking.",Gift of R. T. Miller Jr.,Chinese,Song Dynasty (960 - 1279),"Compared to earlier Chinese dynasties, the Song dynasty (960-1279) placed relatively few restrictions on economic production and encouraged the growth of commerce. The lure of profit and the spread of ideas led to an explosion of innovation and creativity in many areas of Chinese art, including ceramics. Over the course of the dynasty, numerous new kiln complexes sprang up across China. 
<br><br>
One important group of kilns was located in Jianyang County in Fujian province. The Jian kilns, as they were known, specialized in producing teawares decorated with brown and black iron-oxide glazes. By carefully controlling the composition of the glazes and the firing conditions within the kilns, Jian potters were able to create a variety of striking visual effects on their wares. The streaked surface on this elegant teabowl is an example of the ""hare's fur"" pattern. It was created by a chemical separation in the glaze that was crystallized by changing the firing atmosphere and lowering the kiln temperature at precisely the right moment. Because there was no way to see the glaze separation inside the kiln, the creation of a successful hare's fur pattern required a great deal of experience and a little bit of luck to achieve. 
<br><br>
Jian wares became popular as a new style of tea drinking gained prominence in China during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Unlike earlier teas that were boiled or brewed together with various flavoring agents, the new style of tea was made using powdered green tea leaves that were whipped to a froth with hot water. The resulting emerald-green liquid and white foam contrasted sharply with the dark glazes of Jian wares and created a strong aesthetic impact.

These canvases were saturated with color and paint, applied with a vigorous brushstroke and palette knife. Indeed, Monticelli's passion for copious amounts of paint was often the subject of ridicule by critics and dealers.

In any event, it does emanate from Asia Minor and is notable for including both a sculpted human figure and an architectural setting, and as an example of Roman imperial art in the Eastern provinces. The scalloped niche in the center under the pediment has a now-lost element (possibly a figure) before it, and the hint of a scalloped area to the right indicates that a figure would have flanked it on that side as well.

Such paintings lauded the noble simplicity of rural life while acknowledging the harsh poverty of this type of existence. Barker of Bath’s depictions of laborers occupy a key position in English art: they echo earlier bucolic views of country life by such artists as Thomas Gainsborough and George Morland, and are precursors of the more realistic, less idealized depiction of rural workers in the works of John Constable and William Holman Hunt. The artist received his early training, copying of old master paintings, through the patronage of a local Bath coach builder. He studied in Italy in the early 1790s and became an expert in the fresco technique; in this capacity he advised on the redecoration of England’s Houses of Parliament in 1841."

The artist's life-long fascination with dance began in the 1860s when he frequently attended the ballet, as well as the opera, café-concerts, and the circus. These performances provided Degas with endless sources of inspiration, and he was able to gain access to the backstage areas and practice rooms of the ballet, where he could study the young dancers in their more unguarded moments.
<br><br>
 In his drawings, Degas developed a repertoire of poses that he used in later works. He often depicted dancers not actually performing, but resting, which is the case here, as the group of tightly massed dancers stand, with two figures in front adjusting their costumes. The small cluster of girls seems to have gathered during a break; they are facing different directions and look neither at each other, nor at the viewer.

Pothos was the personification of longing, closely associated with Himeros (desire) and Eros (erotic love). Two large-scale statues of the god were made by Skopas, one for the temple of Aphrodite at Megara, near the city of Corinth, and the other for the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace; for both statues, Pothos was depicted as part of a cult group surrounding Aphrodite.   
<br><br>
The Pothos type, which survives in Roman copies such as this, is possibly a replica of the Samothracian statue; the cult on the island was famous in Hellenistic and Roman times. The complete figure was a youth who held a long, stafflike object with both hands, leaning on it with crossed legs, and gazing up at Aphrodite. A goose, one of Aphrodite's attributes, appears at his feet. A long cloak draped over his left shoulder fell to the ground, acting as an additional support for the weight of marble (a remnant of the marble strut that would have connected to this is visible on the AMAM work).

The artist's deep religious convictions resulted in several important works on spiritual and biblical themes. His well-known printing project, entitled <i>Miserere</i> and published in 1927, was composed of a cast of religious and secular characters linked together by familiar phrases and passages from the Bible. <i>Nocturne (Gethsemane)</i> refers to the passage found in three of the Gospels in the New Testament where Christ has gone to the place called Gethsemane to pray with three of his apostles who end up falling asleep.

Pissarro's vantage point offered a plunging perspective that accentuated the steep difference of levels between rooftops, bridge, boats, and the river. In this painting of the Pont Neuf, which links the Ile de la Cité to the right bank, the brushwork is looser and the colors more unified than in his earlier pointillist compositions. By eliminating certain whites and thinning his mineral oil medium with turpentine, Pissarro was able to achieve purer colors and at the same time heighten the transparency of the hues. The evenly cast haze saturates every part of the picture. Painted ""wet on wet,"" the different colors dissolve into each other, creating a subtle fusion of the natural elements."

Two principal traits of the artist - the delineated, monumental forms and realistic sense of space - may be tied to contemporary Netherlandish painting.

Miller Jr. Fund,Flemish,,"In this sumptuous self-portrait by Flemish artist Michiel Sweerts, the soft backlighting and vivid physicality of the palette, together with the artist's frank expression, convey an almost otherworldly sense of distinguished self-esteem. Sweerts had spent nearly a decade in Rome, working in part for the nephew of Pope Innocent X, Prince Camillo Pamphili, but returned to his native Brussels by 1656, where he opened an artists' academy. The AMAM painting shows the artist dressed as a gentleman, proudly holding his brushes and palette in a landscape more reminiscent of central Italy, with its rolling hills, than of Flanders. The portrait was likely made around the time of his return to his former home, based on its coloristic relationship with other works by the artist, and comparison with two other known self-portraits. While artists had a long tradition of depicting themselves with the tools of their trade in their studios, it is unusual to find an ethereal landscape setting for such a work. 
<br><br>
The pigments on the artist's palette- taken from his actual working palette and deposited with extraordinarily lifelike effect-were analyzed in 1954 and can be identified as those used widely by painters in the seventeenth century. They are (counterclockwise from upper right): vermilion, red lake (possibly madder), white lead, yellow ochre, red ochre (or Venetian red), terra verte, a warm brown lake (such as burnt sienna), a brown (like raw umber), a dark yellow (raw sienna), a dark brown (resembling sepia, or possibly Van Dyck brown or carbon black), and a lost pigment that was likely a blue.

In this late work, he had long abandoned the primary Impressionist concerns with the study of light and color in nature, in favor of a more linear style and a highly charged decorative palette.

In his youth, his father was put into debtor's prison for a time and this left a lasting impression on the artist. In later life, he sold prints after his paintings to ensure that his works were available to the middle class, rather than depend solely on a handful of wealthy patrons.
<br><br>
Hogarth's portrait of architect Theodore Jacobsen (ca. 1686-1772) is evidence of the close connections between the artist and the sitter, both of whom-along with a man long presumed to be the first owner of the work, Sir Jacob Bouverie-were prominent London figures in the 1730s and '40s. It has been suggested that the house plans held by Jacobsen depict the triangular Longford Castle, home of Bouverie, though there are discrepancies between the plan and the finished building. 
<br><br>
In 1742, when his portrait was painted, Jacobsen was the architect of the Foundling Hospital, a home for children of unwed mothers; both Hogarth and Bouverie served on the hospital's board. Hogarth was an advocate for an English school of art, separate from the perceived aristocratic and religious traditions of French and Italian schools. At the Foundling Hospital, he helped create a collection of works donated to the institution by English artists, one of the first such spaces for the public display of native art. 
<br><br>
Jacobsen's elaborately embroidered waistcoat and the frills at his wrists show him to be a man of fashion and means, while his ruddy complexion and the turn of his body toward the viewer give him a sense of energy and movement. By placing him in a landscape setting, with pen and plan in hand, instead of in an office, Hogarth shows Jacobsen as actively engaged with the English land through his building efforts.

Vrancke van der Stockt probably trained with his father in Brussels, but the most pervasive influence on his art came from Rogier van der Weyden.

The Latin text at the top of the cross reads, ""Here is Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."" Christ's body is depicted as very thin, with ribs clearly apparent; he hangs lightly from his arms, without great weight. His eyes and mouth are slightly open and blood drips from his wounds.

Rising almost eight feet, a work such as this is very rare and derives from similar paintings by Giotto di Bondone and his school, including that of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, important for its naturalistic depiction of Christ. Such crosses are known from the eleventh century but reached their height of development in the fourteenth century. The early Italian scholar Richard Offner attributed Oberlin's work to the workshop of the Master of the Corsi Crucifix, active in Florence in the 1330s. A painting such as this would have been placed above the high altar in a church, on the reverse of an altar, on a rood screen (separating the laity from the choir), or perhaps in a family chapel.

Death was a persistent presence in the lives of early Americans, and one way they coped was to memorialize loved ones by wearing mourning jewelry. Rings, brooches, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets were among the most popular forms of jewelry and would often incorporate the hair of the deceased into their designs. A lock of hair might be contained within a locket, or it would be intricately woven to create the decorative form of earrings or a brooch. The use of hair in mourning jewelry was popularized by Queen Victoria during her deep sorrow after the death of her husband Prince Albert in 1861. Americans especially embraced this practice during the Civil War, when soldiers would leave a lock of hair with loved ones in case they died during battle.

Renouncing both food and clothing, Mary Magdalene relied only on her long hair for warmth and subsisted only on the Eucharist that angels brought to her each day. At the bottom left of this gradual leaf, Mary Magdalene emerges from a rocky landscape, her body concealed by long, cascading hair, as an angel serves her communion. The lyrics accompanying this illumination, translated as, “The dew of Hermon makes green the mountains of Zion,” were sung at mass on Mary Magdalene’s July 22 feast day. The angelic communion was appropriate for this liturgical performance, and the emphasis on the Eucharist is shared by many other images in choir books. 

 

The book’s anonymous artist was an important illuminator and panel painter in Florence; scholars gave him the nickname Maestro Daddesco (the Daddi-esque Master) because his work relates to the Florentine painter Bernardo Daddi.

Standing before a lectern, choir members read from these books in unison or responsorially, reciting or singing lyrics that corresponded with each day’s worship.
<br><br>
Used each day of the liturgical year, graduals and antiphonaries were composed of heavy parchment bound between leather-covered planks of wood. Though built to withstand daily use, their historiated initials and embellishments were delicately illuminated and often made of valuable materials such as gold leaf. Beyond enabling readers to keep their place within the large volumes, these illuminations provided visual counterparts to the subjects included throughout the text of the choir books and served as devotional aids for their readers.
<br><br>
This gradual was made for use in a church of the Dominican order. The order’s founder, Dominic de Guzman, died in 1221. In 1233, anticipating his canonization as a saint, his Dominican followers moved his body from its humble burial spot to a more prominent tomb at their convent in Bologna, Italy. According to legend, when Dominic’s tomb was opened, the saint’s body miraculously issued a sweet odor, which witnesses interpreted as a sign of his holiness. Five friars in this historiated initial lift Dominic’s body, as a halo of light, signifying his sanctity, encircles the saint’s head. Pope Gregory IX officially declared Dominic to be a saint on July 3, 1234, a year after his body was translated.

(33.2 × 22.2 cm),Fragment,Gift of Robert Lehman,Italian,,"The historiated initial in this leaf commences the text that reads, in translation, “Lavishly, he has given to the poor.” Deriving from Psalm 112, these words relate to an event that led directly to Saint Lawrence’s martyrdom. Pope Sixtus II had appointed Saint Lawrence as archdeacon, entrusting the saint with looking over Church’s treasures. After Sixtus was martyred, however, the prefect ordered Saint Lawrence to turn over the valuables to him. Lawrence asked for three days to do so, during which time he instead distributed the Church’s treasures among the poor. As a result of his actions, Saint Lawrence suffered a fiery martyrdom on a gridiron, as represented in the lurid illumination of this gradual leaf, used on an August 10 feast day for the saint’s martyrdom. The artist, one of the leading book illuminators in Milan, is named for his work in a copy of Suetonius’s Lives of the Caesars (Vitae Imperatorum) made for Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan.

The scroll bears an abbreviated version of Latin words meaning, “Behold the Lamb of God,” through which John announced the coming of Christ. The lyrics of this leaf reiterate this, also identifying the saint as “The precursor of the highest King,” in a sequence used at the mass commemorating the John the Baptist’s decollation. Saint John’s beheading occurred after King Herod Antipas promised to fulfill any request of a young woman named Salome, whose dancing had pleased the king. As instructed by her mother, Herodias, who had been chastised by the saint, Salome asked for Saint John’s head on a platter. Her action brought about Saint John’s beheading, which medieval Christians honored on an August 29 feast day.

When Assisi was attacked in 1243 under the orders of Emperor Frederick II, a sick Saint Clare went to the monastery in order to pray, bringing with her a monstrance bearing the Eucharistic host. While Clare prayed, a child’s voice came from the monstrance and promised to protect her. This gradual leaf references this legend, portraying Saint Clare holding the Eucharistic host in a monstrance, along with a white lily, an attribute representing her purity. Placing strong emphasis on the importance of the Eucharist, the image would have been an appropriate decoration for the introit sung at Mass on Saint Clare’s feast day, August 12. This leaf comes from a gradual that was part of a large set of choir books commissioned by Cardinal Johannes Bessarion, a leading humanist scholar who also worked to reconcile the Catholic and Orthodox Churches."

In 1264, Pope Urban IV added the feast of Corpus Domini (the Body of the Lord) to the church’s liturgical calendar; it is a movable feast falling on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday of each year. The initial “C” began the phrase “Calicem salutaris” (The cup of salvation), which was read during the office of Vespers on this feast day. The image within the initial, appropriate to this feast, shows a radiant monstrance displaying a consecrated host. The image refers to the widespread practice of displaying consecrated Eucharists in churches, so that Christians could adore Christ’s presence in the host even when a mass was not in progress.

He refined and publicized his ideas about the genre in the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>, or <i>Book of Studies</i>, a series of 70 prints published in 14 installments between 1807 and 1819. Advertising his artistic range, Turner categorized the prints as historical, mountainous, pastoral, marine, and architectural.<br>
<br>
A prominent subject in the architectural prints is ruins. Like other artists of his generation, Turner was fascinated by the awesome and terrifying power of nature to overwhelm human efforts to establish order and structure. This theme is already evident in the frontispiece to the series, in the Gothic arcade in the background and the fallen architectural fragment on the right.<br>
<br>
Some 19th-century critics understood this image to be deeply pessimistic and symbolic of the decay of European civilization. Others saw cause for optimism, interpreting the flourishing of nature as a sign of the self-regenerating potential of art."

In the foreground, a woman kneels by a stone trough in what may be an act of purification. Two shepherds, standing near their flocks, converse. The compositions in Turner’s Liber Studiorum, of which this forms a part, were divided into genres.

Turner’s contemporaries drew a moral lesson from the dilapidated state of the abbey and its use by animals rather than the original Cistercian monastic community. Critic John Ruskin wrote: “Here, where the dark pool reflects the chancel pillars, and the cattle lie in unhindered rest, the soft sunshine on their dappled bodies, instead of priests’ vestments; … Strong faith, and steady hands, and patient souls—can this, then, be all you have left?”"

This print showcases Turner’s pictorial talents in landscape, a genre that he would come to redefine with his innovative and dramatic depiction of light and atmosphere. His contemporary John Ruskin noted the exceptional, if improbably flawless, quality of Turner’s treatment of this narrative’s setting: “I can hardly imagine anything so perfect to have been obtained from the real thing; but we know that the imagination must have begun to operate somewhere, we cannot tell where, since the multitudinous harmonies… could hardly in a real scene have continued so inviolately sweet.”

Overcome with the excitement of flight, Icarus did not heed his father’s advice and fell into the ocean.

The man is the groom, dressed in antique scholar’s robes and shaded by his attendant’s parasol. He balances on the head of a large dragon-carp, a symbol long associated with success. For a scholar, the surest route to wealth, power, and honor was to pass the highest level of the competitive imperial civil service examination. This extraordinary feat was compared to the efforts of the mythical carp, whose perseverance in struggling up a famous waterfall was rewarded through its transformation into a dragon."

(8.1 × 2.5 cm),Grotesque ornament with a harpy,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Italian,,"Used by goldsmiths to create a black enamel background on engraved silver, niello was also utilized to create some of the earliest Italian engravings. Prints were often made with the engraved silver plates so that the goldsmith could check the work’s progress, but these designs soon became a style of printmaking wholly apart from silver decoration. Peregrino da Cesena created engravings in the style and proportions of nielli, many of which draw upon themes and designs inspired by antiquity, such as in this work. 
<br><br>
Grotesque ornament—interconnected patterns incorporating scrollwork, fantastic human and animal figures, and vegetation—captured the imagination of Renaissance artists after the late 15th-century archaeological discovery of ancient palaces and villas in Rome and Naples with the decoration on their interiors. Its appeal rested largely in the fact that it provided artists a forum for experimentation with fantastical forms and designs recalling the amusing drollery found in the margins of medieval manuscripts.

It is the first such <I>cassone</I> panel to be firmly connected to the workshop of the artist Apollonio di Giovanni, who had the most successful shop for such works in fifteenth-century Florence. The coats-of-arms depicted on the painting are those of the wealthy and important Vettori and Rucellai families, and, as a marriage between those families occurred in 1463, the work can be securely dated to that time. Additionally, the account books for the shop confirm that the <I>cassone</I> was made for that marriage, and give the price as fifty florins, making this panel an exceptionally well-documented piece. 
<br><br>
Here, Xerxes and his Persian army are shown in combat with the Athenians Pericles, Cimon, and Themistocles, whose names, along with that of Xerxes, have been written on it. (Historical license has been taken, however, as Pericles did not take part in this battle.) Earlier in its history, the panel was paired with another from a second chest, showing <I>The Triumph of Themistocles and Cimon</I>; this panel was destroyed in the Second World War. The end panels that accompanied the Oberlin painting showed knights in combat watched by a young couple, and horsemen fighting before a royal castle, while those of the paired chest showed a young couple in a chariot with Moors, and women collecting fruit and flowers. Images of historical and courtly scenes, depicting love, chivalry, and valor, were typical themes for Renaissance marriage chests. The art historian Paul Watson has determined that Apollonio di Giovanni drew not only on ancient historical sources, but also on the work of Italian humanist writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio for the images on the two <I>cassoni</I>; the end panels connected with Oberlin's work depicted scenes from the latter's poem, ""The Thesiad of the Marriage of Emilia,"" appropriate for such a nuptial chest. 
<br><br>
The narrative, action, and profusion of detail in this work-of costumes, banners, armor, ships, tents, and animals, as well as of textures incised into the areas of gilding- make it a visual delight, as well as an extremely important piece of evidence for fifteenth-century Florentine panel decoration and <I>cassone</I> construction.

This luminous image in clear, cold colors of grays, whites, blues, and blacks is remarkable for the quality and intensity of the light shining into the large ecclesiastical interior. The capitals, gothic arches, and tracery, as well as height, give the interior a sense of majesty, even though, in conformity with Protestant iconoclasm, it is primarily devoid of other ornamentation, save a few escutcheons, or death shields, that served as ""tombstones"" of a sort.

The first earthquake struck Edo (modern Tokyo) on November 11, 1855, and was followed by 119 others that year. Records from the time indicate that 6,641 deaths and many injuries occurred inside the city. Much of the ancient capital, whose architecture was largely constructed of wood, was ravaged by fires spurred on by the unending aftershocks.<br>
<br>
In this print, dating from the tragic year of 1855, anthropomorphized catfish rescue earthquake victims from underneath a collapsed structure. The earthquakes were frequently blamed on a giant catfish that thrashed about, and Ansei quakes were no exception. Despite the devastating effects of earthquakes, those thought to be caused by catfish were understood as helpful, acting as means of reforming feudal society and its corrupt governmental system. These environmental disasters also presented society with occasions to lower income inequality by employing people to rebuild the city. In this context, catfish function as a symbol of both destruction and renewal, despair and hope.

He was the son of a high counselor to Emperor Go-Daigo (1288–1339) and in some stories is linked romantically with the emperor. When Kumawaka’s father is unjustly accused, exiled, and executed, he vows revenge. After killing the man who executed his father, Hino is pursued by the man’s forces but escapes by swinging over a moat on a long bamboo stalk, seen here.

The school's foundation, in 1919 in Weimar, came out of a desire to form closer connections between theory and practice and the ""fine"" and ""applied"" arts, inspired in part by the earlier English Arts and Crafts movement. Klee had been invited to the school by architect and Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius and taught there from 1921 to 1931. Classes or workshops at the Bauhaus were taught by two masters-that ""of form,"" a ""fine"" artist, and that ""of handwork,"" a ""craftsman."" 
<br><br>
During Klee's time at the Bauhaus, he was interested in spatial studies, and made many drawings in which he explored geometric relationships between objects. In this painting, the Cubist-inspired forms are accompanied by two drumsticks finished with black and red balls, a wind-up handle, and a cylinder-like shape. These forms identify the objects depicted as a kettledrum organ, an instrument related to a calliope in which compressed air is passed through whistles. An elfin figure at lower center, wearing a pointed red hat, is a humorous, if ambiguous, presence; it may represent either a jack-in-the-box figure, or the ""soul"" of the organ's music itself. Klee's father was a music teacher, and the artist was equally proficient in music and art.

This painting was confiscated from the Dessau museum in 1937 by the Nazis as an example of degenerate art, and published as having ""Bolshevist"" tendencies.

In the background is a strongly sunlit meadow, in which several small figures wander; closer to the pond, others congregate. The only trace of human intervention in the landscape is the rush of water that bubbles into the pond from a wooden channel.

This calm, peaceful view was made the same year that Hobbema was appointed as a wine-gauger for Amsterdam, a securely paid and socially prominent position that involved measuring the amount of wine in vintners' casks for taxation.

Prentiss Bequest,English,,"As the first President of the Royal Academy, Joshua Reynolds exerted an unmatched influence on eighteenth-century British culture.  In a series of ""Discourses"" presented in 1769-90 he advocated an artistic programme of idealized nature, edifying subjects, and invention achieved by imitating and improving upon the Old Masters.  The Discourses were translated into three languages for an international readership that included Marie Antoinette and Catherine the Great. 

In this ""fancy picture"" Reynolds departed from his standard conventions.  A product of the artist's imagination, or ""fancy,"" the genre usually featured children in natural settings, accompanied by sentimental literary or anecdotal elements.  Images of children increased from the mid-eighteenth century, when Jean-Jacques Rousseau's writings initiated an understanding of childhood as a distinct stage of human development.  This painting is one of several versions, possibly created by Reynolds in order to experiment with his technique.

This painting epitomizes Turner's light, airy palette of cadmium yellows, whites, and the occasional touches of deep red. It was made for Turner's friend, the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey, R.A., and was first exhibited in 1841 at the Royal Academy in London. Reviews of the 1841 exhibition praise Turner's Venetian pictures for ""the clearness of air and water"" and as being ""a glorious example of colour, leaving, as usual, much to the fancy of the spectator; and absolutely extorting applause."" Here the mouth of the Canale della Giudecca-with carefully placed gondolas- dynamically leads toward the horizon, with the Doges' Palace (Palazzo Ducale) and the Riva degli Schiavoni in the center, and the Piazzetta San Marco with the Campanile and the Libreria Sansoviniana to their left. The domed church of San Giorgio Maggiore dominates the right middle ground. Oberlin's painting, brilliantly executed in three layers over white ground, is in excellent condition with impasto and glazes still intact.

In later years he was noted for his scientific experiments in animal husbandry. In the United States, he was as well known for his etchings (he was a trained graphic artist) as for his bucolic paintings of shepherds and sheep.

To capture the same, Daubigny began sketching outside in the open air, often traveling to the forest of Fontainebleau, located about 40 miles from Paris. There, near the village of Barbizon, he worked with a group of artists who later became known as the Barbizon painters. Daubigny's contemporaries sometimes criticized the sketchiness of his finished canvases. However, it was this free handling of paint and his ability to depict natural forms in summary terms that appealed strongly to the next generation of artists, who became known as the Impressionists."

After Dr. Allen became a Trustee of Oberlin College in 1898, the needs of the newly formed art department were always among his primary concerns. This is undoubtedly due to the inspiration of his friend and former professor, Adelia Field Johnston, who was the first to teach the history of art at Oberlin College. Dr. Allen was energetic in raising support for the funding of a building for the arts and worked closely with the architect, Cass Gilbert, on the plans. When he died in 1915, his widow Elizabeth assumed the cost of the building as a memorial to her husband.

<br>
Rembrandt depicts Christ purifying souls and healing the sick by incorporating different scenes from chapter 19 of the Gospel of St. Matthew. The chiaroscuro effects divide the print into two sides of light and dark, adding depth and enhancing the position of Christ as a beacon of light. Rembrandt’s usage of shading draws visual attention to Christ’s powers as a physical and spiritual healer and challenges common conceptions of good and evil as they relate to light and darkness. The varying appearances and unembellished outlines show that each person has their own reason to see Christ. Here in the darkness is where true faith lies.<br>
<br>
Belief and disbelief are present in the crowd, but Christ stands above them all. He is the center that draws together all—the sick on his right seeking to be cured and a skeptical group of Pharisees to his left. Invested with divine powers, Christ defies the boundaries of what is possible and socially accepted."

The gargoyles perched atop Notre Dame Cathedral overlook the Saint Jacques Tower and the city streets below, many of which—dirty, narrow, and dimly lit—still looked much the same as they had in the middle ages. For Meryon, Paris is a city of lustful appetites, which no amount of urban reform can quell.
<<br>><<br>>
Meryon chose to personify “Luxuria,” or Lust—one of the seven deadly sins—as a stryge (translated here as vampire), a creature from Greek mythology with the head of a woman and the body of a bird. The stryge also has a long association in French with the figure of the prostitute. When Baudelaire wrote to his mother about this print, he likely referred to a moral abyss as much as to a topographical one: “The hideous and colossal figure [...] is one of the figures decorating the exterior of Notre Dame. In the background is Paris, viewed from a height. How the devil this man manages to work so calmly over an abyss I do not know.”

Arhats were popular in China due in part to their similarity to native Chinese deities, the Daoist immortals, who were also portrayed as eccentric-looking, highly evolved human beings with supernatural powers. Because the arhats usually appeared in groups (16, 18, or 500), and their iconography in China was not as fixed as it was for other deities, they provided many opportunities for artists to demonstrate their creativity and imagination.

In this painting we see a group of arhats, dressed in monastic robes and carrying characteristic objects such as rosary beads, a monk’s staff, a fly whisk, and a basket of holy texts, or <I>sutras</I>. They are accompanied by a young attendant riding an imaginary beast. To the group’s amusement, two phoenixes have appeared, perhaps summoned by the attendant’s horn.

This painting is an idealized vision of the elite, private gardens and literary gatherings held by wealthy officials and scholars in late imperial China. But where are the women?

It contained the baby Erichthonius, son of Vulcan and Gaia, whose legs were in the form of snakes. Naturally, they opened the basket (the youngest daughter, Aglauros, is seen in this act in the AMAM painting), where, to their shock, they found the deformed child. According to some accounts, they were so horrified at the sight, they threw themselves from the heights of the Athenian Acropolis. Art historian Julius Held, however, noted that in the Oberlin painting, Ovid's version of the tale is depicted, as no harm comes to the daughters and as a landscape-not the rocky outcropping of the Acropolis-is seen in the background. 
<br><br>
The AMAM canvas is a fragment of the complete work, whose composition can be deduced through preliminary sketches, prints, and a number of copies. The complete painting was in the collection of the Duc de Richelieu in 1676, but by 1786 when it appeared in an auction as ""a female gardener,"" it had been significantly cut down, and overpainted: Erichthonius had been covered over by blossoms, so that the entire composition looked like a young girl with a basket of flowers; the various limbs of her sisters, seen in the AMAM work, had also been overpainted. In 1939, the Rubens scholar Ludwig Burchard recognized the composition from a Rubens print, and suggested cleaning the work, after which the original composition was discovered. 
<br><br>
The painting is from the last decade of Rubens's life, and displays the brilliant coloration, sheen of silks and satins, and free handling for which he is known. Rubens was the foremost Flemish artist of the seventeenth century, and was widely known throughout Europe for his inspired compositions and sumptuous coloring. He ran a large studio and served as painter to the Duke of Mantua, the Spanish and French courts, the Habsburgs, and a vast array of other notables, often serving both as artist and diplomat.

(60.6 × 47.9 cm),Several background strokes. Straight profile facing left outlined in darkest line.,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,German,,"Käthe Kollwitz, one of the great graphic artists in the history of printmaking, began her studies in Berlin in the late 1880s. In 1891, she married Karl Kollwitz, a doctor who worked in the slums of North Berlin. The couple lived in the community that Dr. Kollwitz served, and the people he treated provided rich subject matter for Kollwitz's art. The death of her son Peter in World War I led her to place new emphasis on the impact of war on women. Kollwitz was the first woman admitted to the Prussian Academy of Art (Preussische Akademie der Künste) in Berlin, but she was forced to leave her teaching post at the Academy when the Nazis came to power. A committed pacifist, Kollwitz's work spoke out against war, hunger, unemployment, and the impoverished working class. Kollwitz died April 22, 1945, just a few days before the Armistice. 
<br><br>
During her long career, Kollwitz produced perhaps as many self-portraits as Rembrandt, turning her penetrating eye on her own visage and body from her student years to the time of her death. <I>Self-Portrait with Hand of Death</I> was made when Kollwitz was ill and depressed, a fact she recorded in her diary. In this rapid lithographic crayon sketch, the artist's well-defined and darkly outlined profile contrasts with the more lightly rendered closed eyes, drawn-up knees, and hunched body. Kollwitz's large hands are a focal point of the composition: her right hand reaches over her body to cover her left ear, seemingly in an effort to turn away from the disembodied hand of Death reaching out to touch her right shoulder.

(36 × 42.1 cm),Shows a cove enclosing the blue sea with the red band indicating the sunset on the horizon.,Friends of Art Fund,American,,"Following five years of travel and study in Europe, John Marin moved to New York in 1911 and painted, drew, and made prints of city and country views in images that became increasingly energetic and fragmented. Maine was a fertile subject for Marin over many years. <I>Small Point, Maine</I>, a lyrical watercolor almost square in format, is an example of his most evocative and poetic style. Freely brushed washes of watercolor-touches of green and brown in the foreground merge into blue and a horizontal stroke of brilliant red-orange- describe a quiet, picturesque site along the coast. Marin's subtly layered planes of color are strategically placed to ensure that the eye follows a specific path through the composition from the near shore to the sky above. 
<br><br>
The AMAM's acquisition of Marin's watercolor in 1943 came about through a combination of Ellen Johnson's tenacity, high-spirited enthusiasm, and good fortune. While Johnson was on leave from her job as Oberlin College art librarian, Hazel King, the AMAM's first curator, asked her to keep an eye out for a good American watercolor for the collection. ""It would be lovely if the museum could get a Marin,"" King said, ""but with the prices he now commands, I know that's way out of the question."" Aware that Alfred Stieglitz's gallery was an early supporter of Marin's work, with many exhibitions devoted to his watercolors, Johnson went to meet the legendary photographer and eventually broached the subject. When she quoted the price Oberlin was able to pay, Stieglitz replied, ""All right then, that's the price,"" and showed her a room filled with drawers and boxes of Marin watercolors. ""Pick out whatever you want,"" Stieglitz said, and left. 
<br><br>
After looking through a ""whole Marin retrospective,"" as Johnson described it, she had just put aside six watercolors when Stieglitz's wife, artist Georgia O'Keeffe, burst into the room and asked what she was doing. ""Mr. Stieglitz said I could select one for an Oberlin Museum purchase,"" replied Johnson. O'Keeffe asked at what price, and when told, was appalled at the low sum. She refused to let Johnson have any of her first four choices. When O'Keeffe got to Johnson's fifth choice, Stieglitz called ""in no uncertain terms, 'Georgia, let her have one of her choices.' "" As Johnson concluded, ""That's how we got our Marin- and how I met Georgia O'Keeffe.""

Fuseli contributed this climactic opening scene from King Lear to John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery.  Lasting from 1786 to 1803, Boydell's gallery capitalized on eighteenth-century claims for Shakespeare as the embodiment of native artistic genius and a muse for the British school of history painting.  Over one hundred paintings after scenes from Shakespeare's plays were displayed, as well as disseminated in a subscription print series.  In this scene, King Lear disowns his favorite daughter Cordelia after she refuses to exaggerate her love to secure her inheritance.

The pun in this caption is lost in translation.

Such depictions often emphasize his wounded, arrow-ridden body, shown here via strong contrasts of light and shadow.

The main figure of Envy sits in the lower foreground devouring her own heart, with her symbolic animal, the turkey, at her side. Around them are scenes illustrating the theme of envy, such as the two dogs fighting over a bone.

Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin devoted his artistic career to still life and genre paintings, the former most often incorporating humble kitchen objects, far removed in spirit from the works of many of his contemporaries in mid- eighteenth-century France such as François Boucher, Carle van Loo, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard . Admitted to the French Royal Academy in 1728 as ""a painter skilled in animals and fruits,"" Chardin rose to positions of importance, all the while painting subjects quite different from the more typical scenes of history and mythology, or portraits of courtiers. With a muted palette and realistic style purely his own, Chardin's paintings recall the small-scale Dutch cabinet paintings that were widely collected in France in the eighteenth century. 
<br><br>
<I>Still Life with a Rib of Beef</I> displays a glazed stoneware jug with lid and a pot with a ladle or skimmer, accompanied by a copper cauldron, white cloth, and onions and leeks on a stone ledge, with a joint of meat hanging above-emblematic elements of Chardin's production in the 1730s. These objects were used and reused by the artist in numerous works, often with subtle variations, and are a testament to his careful observation of ordinary utensils and foods. Rendering the varying textures of each individual object obviously appealed to Chardin, and his painted surfaces are often thick and without glazes. He painted slowly and deliberately, with small strokes of colors applied side by side as opposed to being mixed together. The tones come together in the viewer's eye, and even his colored shadows seem to vibrate with light and atmosphere. Modest in both size and subject, Chardin's paintings and the objects they depict speak for themselves, proclaiming not grandiosity but rather a solid, middle-class order and harmony.

Circular with central square medallion with inscription surrounded by two dragons and various symbols.,Bequest of Mary McClure (OC 1918),Chinese,Yuan Dynasty (1272 - 1368),"Bronze mirrors like this one were common in China for millennia before the introduction of glass mirrors from the West. They are usually round and have highly polished faces. The rear often had relief decorations as well as a central boss with a hole for a cord to be strung through for hanging. Although they could be used to look at oneself, such mirrors also had important symbolic and ritual functions.<BR>
<BR>
The back of this mirror has a complex design of dragons against a floral pattern. The dragons, pursuing flaming pearls, seem to chase each other around the square center. This combination of circle and square is a symbol of great antiquity, usually given cosmological significance: the circle symbolizes the round dome of the sky; the square, the earth with its four directions.<BR>
<BR>
The square center is inscribed with the date of the fourth year of Zhìyuán (至元四年), a period in the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) that lasted from January 21,1338, to February 8, 1339. This was during the reign of Toghon Temür, the last Mongol emperor of China, who was overthrown in 1368.

This drawing was made during the artist’s time in Paris in the late 1920s, during which he made contact with numerous artists and writers.

Covarrubias’s internationalism during the 1920s and 30s contrasted greatly with the regional focus of the Mexican School. After returning to Mexico in the 1940s, however, he turned much of his attention back to the customs and traditions of his native land.

Incised designs on the legs of the base list donors. On the back of the steele a large, central Buddha with six others below.",R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Chinese,Northern Qi Dynasty (550 - 577),"Buddhism originated in India sometime around the sixth century BC and later spread to lands across Asia. It first reached China during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), but was initially slow to win converts from their native Confucian and Daoist belief systems. When the Han dynasty collapsed, the ensuing centuries of conflict, confusion, and general hardship made people more receptive to the Buddhist doctrines of peace and freedom from suffering. The new religion took root especially in northern China, where several dynasties embraced Buddhism as their official religion. This sculpture was made in one of those northern states, the Northern Qi, which existed for a brief period between 550 and 577. 
<br><br>
The sculpture depicts Sakyamuni Buddha, the Indian prince turned holy man who gained enlightenment (the term Buddha means ""enlightened one"") and founded the Buddhist religion. He is portrayed here wearing a monk's robes and a beatific smile on his face. His hands are held palms outward, one pointing up and one down, in a gesture that signifies reassurance and compassion. He is surrounded by a kind of halo called a mandorla that represents the golden aura of spirituality that emanated from the Buddha's body. He stands on a lotus blossom base. Because the lotus grows from the mud to become a beautiful flower, it was often used in Buddhist art to symbolize transcendence from the human world of suffering and pain. The lotus is supported on either side by lionlike beasts and in the center by a tiny humanoid figure that may represent an earth spirit. The guardian beasts and earth spirit were borrowed from native Chinese folk beliefs and show how Buddhist artists appropriated existing imagery to help win new converts to the religion. 
<br><br>
The stele is carved from a distinctive type of black limestone that is found in northern China and was used by many Buddhist sculptors during the fifth and sixth centuries. Although the stone has a pleasantly austere appearance that seems perfectly in keeping with Buddhist doctrine, in fact the sculpture would originally have been brightly painted. The square head, volumetric body, and fluid lines of the drapery are all characteristic of Northern Qi sculpture. With its aura of calm compassion and approachable familiarity, the sculpture reveals far better than any text how securely ensconced Buddhism was in China by the second half of the sixth century. 
<br><br>
Because it is so well preserved and so iconographically rich, this stele is a remarkably effective teaching tool. The sculpture is regularly studied by classes from the Art History, History, and Religion Departments and has become one of the icons of the Allen Memorial Art Museum.

Kandinsky was captivated with the woodcut technique, claiming that this medium synthesized elements of music, poetry, and the fine arts. He saw working with woodcuts as crucial to the development of his painting, and thus an important introduction to his later abstractions."

Drawing in equal parts on fantasy, theoretical texts from antiquity, and direct observation, he created an allegorical figure he called Nemesis. Shaping her body according to mathematically based Vitruvian proportions, Dürer also enlivens her form with unidealized characteristics, such as her ample rump and belly. Other fantastical attributes, for example the sphere beneath her feet and the wings on her back, associate her with Fortune and Victory. The landscape below is astonishingly detailed in its mastery of perspective and miniature form, but it is not clear what relationship it might have to the figure who walks in the heavens above it. As is common in Dürer’s prints, figures and themes conjured from his imagination are rarely the result of direct quotation from a single, identifiable source. Rather, they function as manifestations of his ingenious creativity."

Papers are strewn about the interior, and a table on the right holds and inkwell and additional papers.",R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,American,,"Benjamin West was born near Philadelphia, where he studied before sailing to Italy in 1760. He spent three years there, primarily in Rome, and was influenced by sixteenth century works as well as those of his contemporaries, who included portraitist Pompeo Batoni. West moved to England in 1763 and lived there until his death, achieving great success; he was a founding member of the Royal Academy and a painter to King George III. 
<br><br>
This small work by West shows General Thaddeus Kosciusko (1746-1817), a Polish patriot who fought for the Americans in the Revolutionary War, and repeatedly for Polish independence against the Russians, Prussians, and Austrians. He is seen reclining on a sofa, propped up by pillows, and holding a hand to his head. A crutch leans against the wall, and a Polish officer's hat of blue velvet and gold braid is visible on a stool, as is a sword-likely the one given to the general by a group of English Whigs in the spring of 1797, when he passed through London. The setting of the painting commemorates Kosciusko's visit to that city: through the window, the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral is visible.
<br><br>
During Kosciusko's stay in London, he was visited by Benjamin West. A journal entry by diarist Joseph Farington for June 8 mentions the AMAM painting, reporting: 

<blockquote>West saw General Koscioscou yesterday. .!.!. The Genl. was laid on a couch-had a black silk band round his head-& was drawing Landscapes, which is his principal amusement. He speaks English, appears to be abt. 45 years of age; and abt. 5 feet 8 Inches high. One side of him is paralytic-the effect of a cannon shot passing over him-He had two stabbs in his back- one cut in his head .!.!. He lodges at the Hotel in Leicester Fields formerly the house of Hogarth. West shewed me a small picture which He yesterday began to paint from memory of Koscioscow on a Couch.</blockquote> 

The intimate quality of the work-and its presence in West's possession following his death-seem to indicate that it was a personal recollection of the artist's encounter with a remarkable man. In 1826, West's sons offered the work for sale to the United States government, as the foundation for a National Gallery. The government rejected the offer, and it was subsequently sold at auction in 1829. The AMAM collection also includes an earlier painting by West, <I>Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph</I>, a larger work of 1766.

Federico Zuccaro began work on the decoration of the chapel there in September 1566, and the drawing dates to that time or shortly afterward. Below the vault, six other biblical narrative scenes appear in circular frames and the chapel walls show images of the apostles and their martyrdoms, as well as other biblical scenes designed by the artist. 
<br><br>
For this central, crowning scene, Zuccaro drew on the inspiration of Michelangelo's fresco <I>God Creating the Sun and the Moon</I> from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Zuccaro, however, changed the direction of God's prominent gesture and gave him a more placid countenance. He also chose to diverge from the narrative that Michelangelo depicted in his fresco (which shows parts of the third and fourth days of creation) and depicts the fourth, fifth, and sixth days by including a landscape scene with grazing animals, birds, and fish. He also modified the composition's overall shape to a circle rather than a slightly elongated rectangle, thereby cutting off much of the sun and the snake and some of the fish and shells at the bottom. 
<br><br>
The drawing was a gift to the AMAM from Robert Lehman (1891-1969), the investment banker and head of Lehman Brothers, who was an important art collector. Lehman gave forty-nine Italian, Flemish and French drawings, paintings, and manuscript leaves, as well as Asian artworks, to the museum in the 1940s. It had previously been in the collection of the Earls of Pembroke & Montgomery at Wilton House in Salisbury, from which it was sold in 1917."

Andreani’s monogram appears in the lower left, along with reference to Raphael as the originator of the composition. Chiaroscuro woodcuts—created by printing with two or more blocks that provide the outline and tonal shading of the forms—became a popular medium in Europe during the late 15th and early 16th centuries.
<br><br>
This print by Ugo da Carpi depicts the miraculous draught of fishes, as told in Luke 5. Although they had not caught any fish the night before, at Jesus' request his disciples placed their nets back into the water. To their surprise, the nets soon started to overflow with fish. In the aftermath of this miraculous occurrence, Peter bows down to Jesus, who sits at the far right.

By composing a figure that shares both the structural and color characteristics of the surrounding nopal pads, Meza coalesces the human into the stand of cacti. The figure's elongated neck and dramatic posture, set among repeated vertical cactus pads, create a sense that the person and nopal thrive as one; together, they grow and endure the harsh, aging, conditions inherent in the painting's dusty desert colors.

The artist likewise took advantage of the lucrative market that developed for his easel paintings and works on paper among American collectors, who were attracted to Rivera’s style and subject matter.

Prentiss Fund,Spanish,,"<I>Glass of Absinthe</I>, which shows a small glass of liquid on a café table, was painted in 1911 during Picasso's Cubist period. In the painting, flat planes of ochres, browns, and blacks slip one on top of each other, creating enigmatic forms, and it is not readily apparent where the glass of greenish liquid is, nor on what it rests. By this point in Picasso's development, objects depicted no longer had to make physical reference to real things, and could be reconfigured and composed in the eye of the beholder. 
<br><br>
The glass is represented at the center right of the work, with curving base and triangular stem, topped by a spoon (that would hold sugar cubes over which chilled water would be poured into the absinthe). Elements of a guitar or mandolin have been seen by some in the painting's center (centered on the black area) and at lower right, a ""cinematograph"" (an early film camera and projector). In conformity, perhaps, with its subject, the image is hallucinogenic, engendering feelings of displacement and slippage. 
<br><br>
The painting was formerly in the collection of one of Picasso's early dealers, Ambroise Vollard, and was purchased for the AMAM from Theodore Schempp, an Oberlin alumnus who became an important dealer of twentieth-century European art. Ellen Johnson wrote of the work: 

<blockquote>Another art friend, Ted Schempp, who had graduated from Oberlin a few years before I did, had become a dealer who lived in France but frequently traveled to the States, bringing with him fine examples of the current School of Paris. As he was in New York for some time that year of the war, he let me have two paintings of my choice to hang in the apartment on West Fifty-second. Thus I had the 
incredible good fortune to live for several weeks with Picasso's <I>Verre 
d'Absinthe</I>, a classic analytic Cubist work, on one wall with its antithesis, a 1913-14 Kandinsky, churning up the space across from it. Of course I sent photographs to Oberlin and the predominantly conservative committee rejected the Kandinsky, as was to be expected but, as was certainly not, they snatched up the Picasso.</blockquote>

Olney Fund,German,,"Working in the Rhineland during the latter half of the 15th century, Martin Schongauer was a leading figure in the development of printmaking in Northern Europe. He is especially well-known today for his developments in modeling and shading, but his skill did not go unnoticed by his contemporaries. As a young artist, Dürer had traveled to Schongauer's workshop with the intention of working with the artist, but Schongauer had died by the time he arrived.  Even after his death, Schongauer's prints remained greatly influential, often inspiring the works of subsequent printmakers.
 
The theme of Christ's Passion appears often in Schongauer's 116 known engravings, the majority of which were devoted to religious subjects.  This print comes from a Passion cycle that begins with Christ's Agony in the Garden and concludes with his Resurrection. Many scholars believe that this cycle was completed in chronological order, and thus charts the evolution of Schongauer's engraving style.

Callot did visit Paris in 1629, but it is unlikely that he was the one to add the view of the city. Upon Callot’s death, some of his unfinished plates went to his compatriot and friend Henriet, who had published Callot’s work during his lifetime. It was probably Henriet, or another artist working for Henriet, who completed the composition by adding the background—and thus changing the meaning—so that the plate could be published"

(49.5 × 40.6 × 68.6 cm),,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Chinese,Tang Dynasty (618 - 906),"China was the richest, most cosmopolitan nation in the world during the reign of the Tang dynasty (618-906). The empire's borders encompassed lands from Korea to Vietnam to Central Asia, and its network of land and sea trade routes stretched even more distantly from Japan and Indonesia to Baghdad and Constantinople. The Tang capital of Chang'an (modern-day Xian) was home to people from all over the world who were drawn to the wealth and excitement generated by this remarkable state. 
<br><br>
This sculpture of an oxcart attended by two grooms was probably made in the vicinity of Chang'an sometime around the middle of the seventh century. The facial features, hairstyles, and clothing of the grooms identify them as Central Asians, probably from Persia or Tajikistan. Central Asians were highly admired in Tang China for their skill in handling horses and other large animals, and it was fashionable to employ them as household servants. Having these exotic foreigners in one's personal retinue was a mark of both wealth and worldly sophistication. 
<br><br>
Although the sculpture is finely modeled and attractive to look at, it was not made as an aesthetic object, but rather as a furnishing for a tomb. During the Tang dynasty, the Chinese conceived of the afterlife as a kind of parallel world where the spirits of the deceased enjoyed many of the same things they enjoyed in this life. To ensure that the afterlife was sufficiently comfortable, the Tang Chinese often buried their dead with actual or symbolic examples of the important possessions they would need or want in the spirit world. These grave goods frequently included ceramic models of people, animals, buildings, and equipment that would have been impractical and immoral to kill or destroy solely for the purposes of burial. Because ceramic is such a durable material, and because grave robbers traditionally never saw much value in them, tomb figures are now one of the most abundant and vivid sources of information we have about life in China during the Tang dynasty. 
<br><br>
Tomb sculptures depicting oxcarts are relatively rare and Oberlin's is one of the finest known examples. The sculpture is among several important Chinese artworks that the AMAM acquired in the years just after World War II with funds provided by Oberlin College alumnus R. T. Miller, Jr. Other objects acquired at the same time and with the same funds include an ancient bronze ritual vessel and a Northern Qi Buddhist stele.

Evans in memory of her husband,Chinese,Zhou-Han dynasty (771 BC–220 AD),"Nephrite is the proper name for the most common type of Chinese jade. It is a hard stone with a complex crystalline structure that makes it extremely difficult to carve. In fact, nephrite is so hard and tough that it cannot be cut or shaped with metal tools, and requires painstaking abrasion with mineral pastes or slurries made of harder stone, such as quartz, garnet, or diamond, in conjunction with various saws, drills, discs, and gouges.  <br><br>
Some of the earliest jade objects were made for religious rituals during the Neolithic Period, as early as 5000 BC. One such early ritual jade form was a disc called a <I>bì</I>, a shape that persisted in Chinese culture for thousands of years. Their original meaning and function has been lost; later tradition associated them with honoring the heavens. <I>Bì</I> were also placed in graves. In later times in China it was believed that jade helped preserve corpses from decay, and it is possible this belief prevailed in ancient times as well.  
 <br><br>
The surfaces of this <I>bì</I> are decorated with a pattern of raised dots that may represent simplified images of seeds or raindrops, a common motif in <I>bì</I> made from the 5th to the 1st centuries BC.  The careful abrasion of the jade's surface that produced this pattern would have required many hours of work, thus making this <I>bì</I> a potent symbol of the owner's power and affluence along with any ritual significance it may have had."

On this sarcophagus is the story of Jonah, who survived in the belly of a large fish for three days and three nights, and who was thought by some to prefigure Christ’s resurrection. On the right side, Jonah lies under ivy after being spit out by the fish. The artist borrowed this reclining pose from the Greek mythological figure Endymion, who wished for perpetual sleep and thus became a symbol of immortality. These narratives would have resonated with early Christians seeking eternal life in heaven.<br>

Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was one of the most important artists in early nineteenth-century France. In his youth, he worked in the studio of Jacques-Louis David and absorbed the principles of classical composition. He worked in both Paris and Rome, creating numerous history paintings as well as portraits. Known for his meticulous, perfectionist practice, Ingres produced a vast number of paintings and drawings of exceptionally high quality and is seen as the last true exponent of the French classical tradition. 
<br><br>
This elegant portrait is of the former Elise Dosne (1818-1880), the fifteen-year-old bride of Louis-Adolphe Thiers (1797- 1877). Distressed by the unfavorable public reception of his painting <I>The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian</I> during its exhibition at the 1834 Salon, Ingres sought to leave Paris. When Thiers, recently named Minister of the Interior of France, announced a search for a replacement for the director of the French Academy in Rome, Ingres immediately sought the post and was appointed in early July of 1834. It is not clear whether Ingres's portrait of Madame Thiers was drawn in supplication or in gratitude for the position, but it was certainly done between April 1834, when Thiers was named Minister, and December of that year, when Ingres left for Rome. Madame Thiers's mother was assumed by contemporaries to have been Thiers's mistress, and it is known from numerous accounts that the union between Elise and the much older Thiers was no marriage of love; those who knew her described Elise as silent and sullen. The sheen of her smooth hair is here marvelously rendered, as befits her beauty, but the blank look of her eyes tends to support the contemporary reports of her demeanor.

The lion's tail rests on the bull's rear upper thigh, as it sits on the bull's back and its claws grip the underbelly of its victim.

Sculptures such as this, popular in ancient Greece, ultimately emanate from the ancient Near East; the scene has been found on Mesopotamian cylinder seals from around 3000 BC, and although its meanings are obscure, may relate to the changing of the seasons, or to wild nature overtaking the domesticated.

Here, the flowing, rhythmic lines and limited, earth-toned palette capture a Western camp where water, bathroom facilities and a place to rest were available for passing travelers.  Auto camping--either in tents or later, in rustic roadside cabins--was a popular American pastime from the 1910s through the 1940s.  Often driving the ubiquitous Tin Lizzie (Model T Ford) and making informal meals from canned goods, ""tin-can tourists"" were a common sight along roads leading to national parks and other popular tourist destinations.

Benton's works are part of the American Regionalist school; he depicted current American scenes and events, and painted murals that focused on American social history.  Although he rejected abstract art and concentrated on stylized, figurative works, among his students was the young Jackson Pollock, who would become the foremost exponent of Abstract Expressionism.

It has been 
suggested that the man’s cane is a phallic symbol and that the urinal in the background is a metaphor for the degraded sexual encounter this scene implies. Toulouse-Lautrec’s jaunty line suggests, however, a joviality that is at odds with such a sinister interpretation.

A powerful and sophisticated civilization, the Khmer empire erected some of the largest and most spectacular temple complexes in world history, including Angkor Wat and the Bayon. This relief may once have decorated one of the many smaller temples built throughout their territory. This figure is an apsara, a type of beautiful female spirit known for grace and elegance who serves and entertains the gods in Hindu and Buddhist texts. Although the specific origin of this sculpture is unknown, the style of the figure and her triple-pointed headdress suggest a date of the late 12th to 13th centuries, during the last great Khmer building campaigns of King Jayavarman VII and his successors.

Miller Jr. Fund in memory of  W. F. Bohn,Chinese,Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 - 1100 BC),"Bronze ritual vessels from the Shang-dynasty culture of ancient China (ca. 1600-1050 BC) rank among the most glorious achievements in the history of Chinese art and are essential to understanding the development of Chinese civilization as a whole. This rare bronze wine vessel from the middle of the Shang period was originally part of a larger set  that was used in ancestor veneration ceremonies. The Shang believed that the spirits of their ancestors acted as intermediaries between the human world and the deities and other forces that controlled the natural world. As long as the ancestral spirits were properly remembered and honored with regular offerings of food and drink, the cosmic order could be maintained. Many Shang bronzes are inscribed with the names of particular ancestors or events that needed to be commemorated. The interior wall of this example is inscribed with two characters <I>tian ding</I> (天丁 in their modern forms), meaning ""Ancestor Ding.""   (The second chracter is abraded and barely visible)
<br><br>
This vessel form (traditionally pronounced <I>jué</I>, although the character today is more commonly pronounced <I>jiǎo</I>) was used to heat and serve wine in religious rituals. Its tripod shape allowed it to be placed into hot embers to heat the wine, which then could be poured into bronze drinking vessels using either spout. Note the head of a bat-like creature in relief where the spouts meet on the front, an animal mask design just below, and an inverted triangular cicada motif on each spout."

Miller Jr. Fund,German,,"Saint Urban, who reigned as Pope Urban I from 222 to 230, is shown here in his requisite garments of cope, tasseled hood, and three-crowned papal tiara. The grapes atop his book indicate his role as the patron saint of vineyards, and this likeness, finished in the round, may have been used in processions through vineyards-many of which surround the city of Würzburg where the sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider worked and where he owned many vineyards himself. As Urban's feast day (May 25) coincides with the time of year when grapes reach a critical stage in their growth, he was a natural choice to act as heavenly mediator for a good harvest later in the year. Originally the figure would have held a staff in his right hand. The lozenge-shaped clasp that joins the sides of his cope is inset with a four-leaved floral design; this was carved separately and set into the lozenge compartment. 
<br><br>
This is the only figure of a pope sculpted by Riemenschneider, who was one of the best-known Gothic sculptors of southern Germany. He produced wooden carvings- both figures in the round and reliefs-for numerous altarpieces, as well as stone sculptures for church exteriors, and the funerary monument for the Prince-Bishops Rudolf von Scherenberg and Lorenz von Bibra in Würzburg's cathedral. He enjoyed great status in that city until 1524-25, when he sided with the peasants in a revolt; he was imprisoned and probably tortured. Although released, he produced no works of great importance after that time.

Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"Claude Monet, one of the founders of Impressionism (which takes its name from his 1872 painting <I>Impression, Sunrise</I>), grew up on the Normandy coast, known for its rapidly changing skies. Sunlight, clouds, and the mutability of the weather were to dominate Monet's works. Known for paintings created <I>en plein air</I>, or outdoors, Monet worked throughout his life in Normandy, in and around Paris, and in the south of France, as well as in London, Holland, and Venice. In the 1880s, he began to spend time at Giverny, near Paris, where he created many works celebrating his water-lily pond.
<br><br>
Oberlin's painting, along with two other horizontal works in The Hague and Berlin, was painted by Monet in spring 1867, from windows at the Louvre. On April 27, the artist had asked for a special authorization to paint ""views of Paris from the windows of the Louvre,"" and on May 20, he wrote the artist Frédéric Bazille that he and Renoir were still busy on their city views. His earliest images of Paris, they were painted shortly after the opening of the city's World's Fair in April and attest to its importance as a growing metropolis. Rather than copy the masterpieces inside the museum, as had generations of artists before him, Monet turned the opposite direction, toward the city itself. The work is evidence of his diverse and inspired early period, presenting a sweeping view of Paris in an unusual vertical composition that shows a slice of the city toward the southeast, through atmospheric clouds; the oblique viewpoint may have been inspired by Japanese prints the artist would have seen at the World's Fair.

The dome of the Pantheon appears in the center distance, flanked by the church of St. Etienne-du-Mont and the dome of the Sorbonne. The Ile de la Cité is in the middle ground, separated from the Right Bank by the Seine, of which a small part is visible at right, under the French flag. The foreground, painted in brilliant green, shows the Garden of the Princess (<I>Jardin de l'Infante</I>), named for a Spanish princess who was briefly engaged to Louis XV in 1722, and whose apartments under the Galerie d'Apollon looked out over the garden. Human figures-so prominent in Monet's works to this point-are reduced to daubs of paint, signifying their movement on foot and in horse-drawn carriages through the transitional spaces of the grand boulevards flanking the Louvre and Seine. 
<br><br>
The painting was purchased from the artist by pianist Charles Wilfried de Beriot around 1873; in a later letter, in which Beriot asked Monet for an updated value for the work, the musician noted that he felt that Monet had a soft spot (<I>un faible</I>) for it, as Monet had valued it at double all his other paintings (1000 francs), at the time of Beriot's purchase.

<br><br>
This still life of a guitar on a table, accompanied by a pitcher and bunch of grapes, was exhibited in the Salon d'Automne exhibition in Paris shortly after it was painted. It was singled out for praise in London's Sunday <I>Times</I> in 1960 by art critic John Russell, writing about works in US college and university museums that had no parallel for quality in their counterpart museums in England. The painting displays the dark tonality that characterized Braque's works made during the German occupation of Paris during the Second World War, with small passages of brighter yellow and peach colors. The layered and textured surfaces are typical of the artist's work at this time.

Bows and spears were typical hunting weapons, but trained dogs, hawks, and cheetahs were also employed. Instead of a hunting partner, this rider carries a masked palm civet (<i>Paguma larvata</i>)—probably a rare pet. He wears a <i>fānlǐngpáo</i> 翻领袍, a knee-length robe with overturned lapels, a widely popular style introduced from Central Asia.<br>
<br>
Tomb sculptures of this type were made from molded sections, attached with clay slip and dried, after which glaze was applied. The colorful glaze on this piece, known as the “three color” (sāncǎi 三彩) glaze, is particularly associated with the Tang period, and the high point of production occurred from the late 7th to mid-8th centuries. Adding lead oxide to the glaze allowed firing at the relatively low temperature of ca. 1500° F. Iron created the yellowish color of the horse, and copper the green sections. Some areas, like the figure’s head, were left unglazed to allow more naturalistic colors to be painted on after firing."

<br><br>
The eminent art historian Erwin Panofsky studied the series and established a parallel between the classical hero Hercules and the Old Testament figure Samson; according to him, the AMAM Samson panel is paired with the Hercules and Antaeus example at Yale. Panofsky also suggested that the Herculean scenes can be read in terms of the Four Elements, wherein the Oberlin and Yale panels represent Earth (as Hercules defeats Antaeus by lifting him from the ground). Wolfgang Stechow suggested the four gods (Neptune, Pluto, Saturn, and Jupiter) can also be read this way, in which Oberlin's Jupiter (as supreme god and often depicted, as here, with an eagle) represents Air.

The anonymous artisan who created the stand made the upright section in the shape of a dragon.

The heavy base of the lamp is in the form of a mythical dragon-turtle, a symbol of longevity. On its back is a three-colored taegeuk (태극; 太極) motif, more familiar in its two-colored form as a symbol of the Chinese principles of yin and yang.

Ludlow,Korean,Koryo Period (918 - 1392),"The celadon glaze was first produced in China around the ninth or tenth century and must have reached Korea not long afterward. It quickly gained popularity there and became the dominant style of ceramic in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). Early Goryeo celadons mostly imitated Chinese prototypes, but by the eleventh century, Korean potters were already developing their own distinctive forms and decorative motifs. One important innovation was the creation of new forms based on natural shapes, such as the melon shape of this wine pot. Korean potters also devised a new way of decorating celadons with designs that were laid into the bodies of the vessels beneath the glaze using black and white clay slips. By the early twelfth century, Goryeo celadons had reached such a high state of development that they even impressed a visiting Chinese envoy, who wrote that the Korean wares compared favorably with celadons produced in China. The Korean celadon industry was badly disrupted by the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century and never regained its former level of excellence as tastes shifted to new styles of stoneware and porcelain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 
<br><br>
This melon-form pot would most likely have been used to serve warm rice wine. Its lid was probably originally attached to its handle by a silver or bronze chain. Fine examples of Korean celadon have long been prized by collectors. This wine pot is one of seventeen pieces of Goryeo celadon that were donated to the AMAM in 1949 by a Cleveland resident who acquired the pieces while serving in Korea as a doctor during the early decades of the twentieth century.

As advances in industry and technology proliferated across Europe, Pissarro’s rural scenes were seen as nostalgic, if not sentimental, odes to the working class. His depictions of agrarian farm life idealized labor, while still posing an alternative to the rapid urbanization of the day. In this scene, a peasant woman feeds a small group of chickens pecking around her feet. Narrowly framed and simplistically drawn, the act of feeding reads as a caring and intimate gesture. Labor is represented as being in harmony with and inherent to nature; the chickens are dependent upon the woman, as she is dependent upon them."

Prentiss Funds,French,,"Paul Cézanne's many paintings of the French fishing village of L'Estaque, just west of Marseilles, explore the beauty of the Mediterranean landscape. Sometimes he depicted the brilliant blue of the sea, while at other times-as here-he turned his back on it to focus on the harsh, rocky terrain of the landscape. 
<br><br>
The immediacy of <I>Viaduct at L'Estaque</I> relates not only to its dense surfaces, built up by the artist with palette knife and brush, but also to the specificity of its location. The railway viaduct, the distinctive evergreen situated on top of the rocky incline at the right, and the two intersecting vertical slopes that suggest the path a train must take through the landscape- all of these are intriguing visual clues that inspired Oberlin College professor of art Ellen Johnson to seek out the site in person. In her memoirs, Johnson described her adventurous quest to determine exactly where and when the painting was made: 

<blockquote> Approaching L'Estaque from the north was like driving right through the back of Cézanne's painting and when I saw it from out at sea, that part of the mountain he had painted was right there in every single contour. Even now, after forty years, I still tingle to remember-more than that-to experience once again the shock of joy at that first recognition.</blockquote>

Johnson's sleuthing also connected Oberlin's Cézanne painting with an 1882 canvas by Renoir, <I>Rocky Crags at L'Estaque</I>, (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). In January of that year, on his return from Italy, Renoir stopped at L'Estaque, where he ran into his friend Cézanne. As described in letters he wrote to friends in Paris, the two artists went out painting together. Renoir's more distant view shows that they were working near the railway viaduct, thus providing a firm date for the Oberlin picture. 
<br><br>
When this intensely compressed landscape, almost square in format, was acquired by the AMAM in 1950, it marked a turning point in the museum's ability to teach Oberlin students in the fields of Post-Impressionism and Cubism. The addition of this single painting served as a key link to help students understand more fully Cézanne's explorations of the tension between ordinary vision and the correspondence of shapes; at the same time, the painting revealed the seminal impact that Cézanne's work had on artists like Picasso and Georges Braque as they pioneered a new kind of pictorial space. The museum already had significant holdings by Picasso, including <I>Glass of Absinthe</I>, a Cubist work of 1911 and Braque's <I>Blue Guitar</I> of 1943.

Epstein first met the Marchesa at a luncheon and asked her to sit for him, which she consented to do the next day.

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, one of the founders of the Die Brücke movement, a group that was the first to bring forth the style of art that would become known as German Expressionism, depicts himself in his studio, where canvases lean against the walls behind him, wearing the uniform of the 75th Artillery Regiment. His right-painting -arm is a bloody stump, his cheeks are sunken, his dark-circled eyes are empty and hollow, and a cigarette dangles listlessly from his lips. Although Kirchner did not suffer the loss of his hand during the war, it broke him emotionally. He had been inducted into the army in early 1915 and assigned to the field artillery, but due to a lung infection and depression was sent away from the front lines and released in the autumn of that year. He subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown and spent time in clinics and sanatoriums. 
<br><br>
The figure behind the artist is ambiguous -likely female, it has masculine overtones- and it is unclear whether it is meant to suggest a live model, or a figure painted on canvas. There is a suggestion of a bent limb-elbow or knee-over Kirchner's shoulder and under the figure's right arm, and the way the figure is inscribed within the dark background-which may continue behind Kirchner-would seem to suggest it is part of a painting. It bears some resemblance to the AMAM's 1919 sculpture by Kirchner, <I>Standing Female Nude</I>. 
<br><br>
This work, with its raw and garish colors, was included in the 1937 <I>Entartete Kunst</I>-Degenerate Art-exhibition put on by the Nazi authorities in Munich, after which it traveled to other cities in Germany in 1937-38. In Munich, the painting was exhibited in room 3, with other Kirchners, as ""Soldier with Whore,"" under the texts ""Deliberate sabotage of national defense"" and ""An insult to the German heroes of the Great War,"" while next to the painting were the (sincere) words of a German curator likening Kirchner's art to that of Dürer: ""We are in the presence of the first German artist to achieve a penetrating quality that can be likened to that of Dürer, E.

He was a famous warrior and general who lived during the turbulent Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD). Guān’s exploits were recorded in histories and romanticized by popular storytellers, novelists, and playwrights. A model of honor and loyalty, he eventually became deified, known first as Duke Guān (關公 Guān Gōng) or Emperor Guān (關帝 Guāndì). Temples to Emperor Guān can be found in Chinese communities worldwide, as he is still an important figure in Chinese religion.<br>

In the poem, Guān Yǔ conveys a message to the warlord Cáo Cāo 曹操, who he was serving under duress, and proclaims his unwavering loyalty to Liú Bèi 刘备, Guān Yǔ’s sworn brother and Cáo’s rival. The bamboo here represents upright virtues; the stalk bending is Guān Yǔ, bowing in respect to Liú Bèi.

Inspired by her travels to Munich, Paris, Florence, Venice, Dalmatia, and Istanbul, Bormann executed street views of each of those places. After the end of World War II, she ventured across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, making woodcuts of landmarks in New York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco.

<br>
This early monochrome print belongs to a subgenre of prints known as parody pictures, or <i>mitate-e</i>. These take elevated themes from classical literature or religion and cast them in contemporary forms, often to humorous effect as a subversive dig at “high” culture. Here, a courtesan and a wakashū, dressed as an apprentice kabuki actor, row a giant rush leaf to help the patriarch cross the river.<br>
<br>
Images of Bodhidharma had another level of meaning to those who worked in the Yoshiwara. The standard period of service was 10 years, although most had to work much longer to pay off debts. Yet Bodhidharma spent just nine years meditating in a cave before achieving enlightenment. In a kind of gallows humor among indentured sex workers, Bodhidharma was criticized, tongue in cheek, as a relative slacker by floating world standards. This is seen here, where he rests while the others row; in most images he stands alone on his rush leaf."

The death of the Buddha (nirvana) was a popular theme with Japanese artists. Animals play an important role in the visualization of this event by unifying the domains of the divine, humans, and non-humans. Among those depicted are an elephant kneeling in reverence to the Buddha and to a mouse, considered by legend to be Buddha’s messenger. The Buddha’s passage from his earthly life and embarkation on the path of enlightenment is witnessed by creatures from all realms of existence. Queen Maya, the Buddha’s mother, descends from heaven (upper right) while human, animal, and supernatural creatures surround the elevated bed to grieve the Buddha’s departure. A large variety of animals such as monkeys, birds, insects, and wild beasts mourn the Buddha, unaware that his passing must be celebrated as an escape from suffering. The artist has drawn from his imagination, or possibly other sources, to depict animals not native to Japan, such as the elephant, tiger, lion, and peacock, but originating from the Buddha’s homeland in South Asia.

A writing box with brushes, an ink stone, and ink sticks sit in front of him. A small, portable book case is open behind him. The candle suggests that he is working at night. He is writing the word “Tanabata...” on a slip of paper. Tanabata is the name of an important festival in Japan celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. A tradition from China, the festival marks the one day of the year that the legendary lovers, the Weaver Princess (<i>Orihime</i>, or <i>Tanabata-tsume</i>) and the Oxherd (<i>Kengyū</i>), can reunite. The pair was banished to live in the sky as the two stars Vega and Altair, separated by the Milky Way.

A tradition during the festival is to write wishes on slips of paper and tie them to branches of sasa bamboo. In the print, the young man is writing a wish, with a sasa branch at the ready behind him. We can see that his wish already is being granted: Orihime is descending on a cloud with her own wish branch.

This composition makes a reference to chapter four of the classic Japanese novel, <i>The Tale of Genji</i>, titled Yūgao, or Evening Faces. The novel’s main character, the prince Genji, spots some beautiful flowers at the hedge fence of a house he is passing. When he orders his attendant to gather some of the flowers, a young girl appears from the house. She gives the attendant a folding fan on which to place the blossoms before offering them to Genji, turning it into a tasteful, impromptu gift from the mysterious lady of the house, with whom Genji soon has an affair. Masanobu transformed the literary episode into a contemporary scene, set in the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter of Edo. Here a young girl representing the courtesan in the background presents flowers on a fan to a customer."

After meeting a handsome young man while her family was living in a Buddhist temple after a major fire in Edo, and continuing a passionate correspondence with him, she set fire to her neighborhood in order to see him again. She was later caught and convicted of arson, a capital offense.
<br><br>
In an Edo version of <i>cosplay</i> (a contemporary Japanese pop-culture term for “dress up,” combining the words “costume” and “play”), the print shows a kabuki fan dressed as Oshichi, holding a copy of a recent play about her. The circle motif at her elbow shows a love letter; the caged bird symbolizes Oshichi’s plight; and the plum blossom (on the cage), pine, and bamboo (on her kimono), known as the Three Friends of Winter, symbolize the New Year’s prayer in which Oshichi accidently revealed her guilt.
<br><br>
A special effect seen in the black bow of the woman’s obi (sash) is known as <i>urushi-e</i> (lacquering). Glue was added to the black ink and burnished after the ink dried, giving it a shiny, lacquer-like gloss.

Her swirling kimono, decorated with poetic verses written in calligraphic script, emphasizes her elegant movements as she turns to strike the shuttle cock.

Although sometimes difficult to distinguish from images of young women, wakashū wore a distinctive hairstyle, with a shaved patch on the tops of their heads.

The print is an example of Harunobu’s mastery of the difficult pillar print format. It also reflects the artist’s love for complex, multilayered subjects. This is a “parody print” (<i>mitate-e</i> 見立絵), and here the reference is to the legend <i>Mugen no Kane</i> 無限の鐘 about a magical temple bell that, when struck, will rain treasures on the bell-ringer but cast them into the eighth, most terrible, Buddhist hell in their next life.

Later in the play it is revealed that the host was none other than Sano Genzaemon Tsuneyo, a samurai warrior and former lord, and the monk is Hōjō Tokiyori, the regent of Kamakura, traveling in disguise."

Ainsworth Bequest,Japanese,Edo Period (1615 - 1868),"Probably a student of Harunobu 春信 —his early prints were signed Haruhiro 春廣—Koryūsai became one of the most prolific 18th century print designers. He was born a samurai but lost his status in 1778, becoming a <i>rōnin<?i> 浪人 (masterless samurai). Legend has it that he relinquished his position to pursue art. His successes in painting and printmaking soon brought him official recognition: in 1782 he was one of very few ukiyo-e artists awarded the honorary rank of <i>hokkyō</i> 法橋 (Bridge of the Dharma) by the government.
<br><br>
Koryūsai was particularly known for pillar prints, and this is a fine example of his achievements in this challenging narrow format. The space is limited, but maximized by the figures and bell tower being partially out of frame. The composition is unified by careful color placement and strong diagonals, which are interrupted only by the attendant’s gaze leading us to the artist’s signature.

The play references a famous Love Suicide (<i>shinjū</i> 心中), a popular genre in Edo period theater in which personal feelings often were pitted against duty. The story of Osome and Hisamatsu was based on actual events that occurred in 1710. She was the daughter of the proprietor of the Aburaya oil shop.

He carries a yellow box of moxa (small cones of the powdered herb, mugwort, to be burned on the body for therapy).<br>
<br>
Ichikawa Danjuro II himself apparently benefitted from a moxa treatment, when a sore throat almost prevented him from performing the previous year. In gratitude, Danjuro worked the product into his next play. Thus the moxa-vendor disguise not only updates the play, but converts it into a vehicle for the celebrity endorsement of a cure-all tonic, its positive effects demonstrated by the vigor and oral abilities of the actor-salesman who had to perform tongue twisters and puns. Danjuro’s emblem is visible on the box of moxa, a form of celebrity branding that kabuki actors were known to have done for products, including toothpaste.

To spend all your efforts on diviners, fortune-telling and votive abstinence may be all very well and even seem charming; yet this too is a [kind of] disease, best avoided. If something is bothering you, you should pray for purification with [an auspicious saying such as] ‘crane and tortoise, pine and bamboo.’ Incantations should be confined to the special holy day [of the Buddha’s Birthday] …”<br>

Ainsworth Bequest,Japanese,Edo Period (1615 - 1868),"This five-sheet print depicts the customs of the five ceremonial festival days (<i>gosekku</i>) that began at the imperial court. Originally held during the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth months of the lunar calendar, the festival dates were changed to the solar calendar in the late 19th century. In each print, activities of the festival are illustrated by finely dressed women and children, and a description is written in the empty spaces of the compositions.<br>
<br>
The five prints are designed to work as individual compositions, perhaps put on view during each festival. As seen here, however, Utamaro also cleverly designed them to work together as a continuous composition, moving through the yearly festivals from right to left. Interestingly, there are some stylistic differences among the prints, and the base of the banner stand seen in the third print does not continue into the fourth print in this impression, although it is found in some examples. This may suggest that the prints were not released together as a set, but over time."

The Edo period isolation policy (<i>sakoku</i> 鎖国) that closed Japan to trade and travel was not absolute. Exceptions included Chinese and Dutch traders, quarantined on the tiny island of Dejima 出島 in Nagasaki harbor, and embassies from the Ryūkyū Kingdom of the south and the Ainu people of the north. Most impressive by far, however, were the embassies from the Korean court, who made only twelve visits to Japan during the Edo period. They would land in southern Japan and make their way north to Edo in a rare, exotic visual spectacle.
<br><br>
So impressive were these events that many local festivals, including at the Yoshiwara and other Edo districts, began to reenact them. Here, the print designer Utamaro combined his typical subject, Edo beauties in the latest styles, with atypical foreign details: distinctive hats and shawls, banners, trumpets, and for the women on horseback and in the sedan chair, elaborate crowns."

(19.1 × 54.5 cm),,Mary A. Ainsworth Bequest,Japanese,Edo Period (1615 - 1868),"The subject of this long, horizontal surimono print is an example of a kind of visual pun popular in the Edo period. Known as “parody pictures” (<i>mitate-e</i> 見立絵), a common version took themes from Chinese or Japanese classical literature and portrayed them in contemporary terms, often creating elaborate intellectual puzzles.

 

The classical subject here is the Six Immortal Poets (<i>Rokkasen</i> 六歌仙) of the 9th century. Although at first seemingly a group of Edo period women reading poems together, the woman in red at the top right helps to establish the theme. Her Heian period (794–1185 AD) clothing and hairstyle identify her as Ono no Komachi 小野小町, the one female member of the Six Immortal Poets. 

On the screen is another member, Ariwara no Narihira 在原業平, in a famous scene from the <i>Tales of Ise</i> (<i>Ise monogatari</i> 伊勢物語) where the poet sees Mt. Fuji and composes a poem. The six figures in the print, then, are probably to be taken as the Six Immortal Poets, with the one covered by the screen a stand-in for Narihira.

Woodblock prints, inexpensive and mass produced, were aimed at the merchant class, who contributed to their popularity. Professional courtesans, such as the woman portrayed here, were among the primary subjects, which also included kabuki actors and landscapes.  

The extravagance and gentle sweeping outlines of the multicolored patterned clothing—both common to <i>nishiki-e</i> (brocade pictures)—suggest a covert eroticism without invoking government-imposed regulations on content and style. These women were highly idealized by <i>ukiyo-e</i> stylistic conventions, however, and the harsh reality of their everyday lives as courtesans was rarely depicted.

Autumn motifs of pampas grass on the lantern shade, in addition to chrysanthemums and Chinese bell flowers (<i>kikyō<i/>) on the women’s kimono, allude to the fall season.

When Enya was ordered to commit suicide after drawing his sword in the shogun's palace, his men swore to avenge him, and, on the anniversary of his death, attacked Moronao's mansion.

Though often focused on the samurai and/or actor classes, Kuniyoshi also uses legends to explore nature outside of human contact. This print portrays Kaidōmaru, the child superhero more commonly known as Kintarō. A popular topic in prints, he is often depicted in red or orange, symbolizing his strength and energy. This supernatural child of the Thunder God and Yamauba (Mountain Witch) grows up with the forest animals—bears, rabbits, monkeys—as his playmates. Here, Kaidōmaru and his animal friends thrust a pole covered with a sticky substance called birdlime into trees to catch song birds. Instead of a bird, however, they accidentally capture a baby Tengu: a half-bird, half-man, mountain goblin. This humorous scene makes an elaborate pun on the name of the town Mochizuki, whose name sounds like birdlime (torimochi) and “a thrust” (tsuki). The town, depicted in the inset landscape, was located on an historic highway between the cities of Edo and Kyoto.

The samurai and hero Takagi Toranosuke, dressed in travel attire, stands on a bluff looking out to the sea, where fishing boats surround a whale. Toranosuke’s reputation as a monster slayer suggests that he is about to fight the whale. In other works by Kuniyoshi, Toranosuke is depicted in an underwater struggle with a creature called a “river tiger” (kawatora, also known as kappa). Although no literary sources have been found, there may be a related story in which the supernatural water monster is replaced by a whale—less unusual, but far more impressive."

Ainsworth Bequest,Japanese,Taisho Period (1912 - 1926),"The introduction into Japan of photography, lithography, and other new image- making techniques during the late nineteenth century posed a severe challenge to the traditional Japanese woodblock printing industry. By 1900, the once popular woodblock-printed images of famous people, places, and stories were regarded by many Japanese as old-fashioned and undesirable in comparison to more modern forms of pictures. Concerned that the art of color woodblock printing might die out in Japan, a businessman named Watanabe Shozaburo (1885-1962) started a movement in 1915 to revive the industry by commissioning designs from a new generation of artists and having the images carved into woodblocks and printed in the traditional manner. Watanabe called his movement the Shin Hanga, or ""New Print,"" Movement and he soon attracted other publishers and artists to his cause. Although the Shin Hanga Movement enjoyed some support within Japan, many of its prints were sold to European and American collectors, whose patronage helped the movement to grow and prosper in the decades leading up to World War II. 
<br><br>
Kawase Hasui was one of the first artists recruited by Watanabe into the Shin Hanga Movement. Trained in both Japanese and Western-style painting, Hasui quickly became known for his picturesque and often romanticized images of landscapes and traditional-style buildings. Over the course of his career, Hasui designed more than five hundred prints for Watanabe, some of which were reprinted numerous times to produce thousands of impressions. Hasui's outstanding artistic achievements and importance within the Shin Hanga Movement were recognized by the Japanese government in 1956, when he was designated as a Living National Treasure. 
<br><br>
<I>The Road at Arayu near Shiobara</I> was designed by Hasui in 1918 and printed by Watanabe in 1919. It depicts the landscape around Shiobara, a town north of Tokyo, which had long been famous for its relaxing natural hot springs. The elongated horizontal format and warm color scheme of this print are unusual for Hasui and reveal it to be an early, experimental work. Because the original blocks for this image were destroyed in the great 1923 Kanto earthquake, it was never reprinted and is relatively rare, especially in the excellent condition of this impression from the Ainsworth collection.

Ainsworth Bequest,Japanese,Edo Period (1615 - 1868),"This series of woodblock prints shows Mount Fuji from a broad array of different viewpoints, each one unique.  Hokusai also produced a series of prints entitled One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, demonstrating that he pursued his quest to portray Japan's highest mountain in all its aspects with a certain obsessiveness.

Against a background of soft clouds blown along by the south wind at the beginning of summer, bare Mount Fuji is here portrayed in russet tones, for which reason it is also known as the ""Red Fuji."" For Hokusai, this was the true aspect of the mountain. The feeling of tension produced by the steep slopes rearing up into the sky has caused this picture to be regarded as Hokusai's masterpiece, as well as a masterpiece among Japanese woodblock prints."

A violent thunderstorm is in progress among thick banks of clouds, accompanied by a sudden downpour. Hokusai has given outstanding expression to the evening atmosphere of Mount Fuji. In contrast to the tranquil landscape seen stretching away to the left of the mountain, the black clouds hugging the mountain's base and the bizarre flashes of lightning appear sinister and threatening. The loftiness of the mountain is emphasized by the fact that the summit looms up into a clear blue sky, where it is crowned by wispy white clouds. The slopes, by contrast, are black and red, increasing the tension within the picture to outstanding effect."

Instead of describing the bustle of the main street, however, Hokusai enlarged the roof of the Mitsui Echigoya textile store and situated the view of Mt. Fuji above Edo Castle. The contours of the shop roofs and the lines created by the kite strings, which resonate with the lines defining Mt. Fuji’s silhouette, reveal Hokusai’s unique approach to composition. Workmen on the rooftop are fixing the roof tiles; one has just flung a bundle of tiles up to another, who reaches out to catch it."

Shiogama is an example of an <i>utamakura</i> 歌枕, or poem pillow. These were place names and other words used in poetry as a shorthand to allude to a set meanings and associations.

This weather phenomenon is always closely related to foxes, who in Japanese folktales often play tricks on humans. A variety of Shinto (a Japanese religion and spirituality connected to nature) rituals and festivals have been developed in various parts of Japan relating to the fox wedding. The fox wedding procession seen here is reenacted on New Year’s Eve at the Oji Shinto Shrine. Human and animal identities are often merged through such performances and events."

This image provides another example of Hiroshige’s love for complex, cut-off compositions. At dusk, a roofed boat quietly, calmly glides across the scene. Inside, the back of a woman can just be seen. On the opposite shore, a view of Kinryūzan Sensōji temple’s main hall and pagoda is depicted, while the view framed by the boat’s roof shows Azuma Bridge and Mt. Fuji. The cherry blossom petals dancing in the breeze and the scenery suggest that this is the west bank of the Sumida River in the neighbor-hood of Mukōjima, an area famous for its cherry blossoms. If this is the case, the woman may be a geisha of this neighborhood, enjoying flower-viewing."

In this series of prints produced at the end of his career, Hiroshige, the renowned pioneer of landscape art in the ukiyo-e genre, explores relations between the natural world and human activity in and around Edo (modern Tokyo). Here we see <i>koinobori</i>, the carp-shaped wind socks typically flown to celebrate <i>Tango no sekku</i>, a traditional event now celebrated on May 5th as the national holiday Children’s Day. Taking up a large part of the foreground, the nearest <i>koinobori</i> in this print boldly dominates the view of Edo, rising above Mount Fuji in the distance. Two others fly in the middle ground. Such wind socks are made by drawing carp patterns on paper, cloth, or other fabric. Landscapes across Japan are filled with <i>koinobori</i> from April to early May in the hope that children (traditionally young boys) will grow up healthy, strong, and successful. The carp is a symbol frequently associated with masculinity in East Asian art, serving as a metaphor for the dragon, a source of energy and strength."

<i>One Hundred Views of Famous Places in Edo</i> was the last series produced by Hiroshige I, and was completed posthumously by his successor, Hiroshige II. The views of Edo, the city known today as Tokyo, are divided into four seasonal groups, and include famous sights, locations, and everyday activities of the townspeople during those seasons.<br>

This print shows a summer festival at the Sumiyoshi Shrine on the island of Tsukudajima in Edo Bay. It was held every three years, and involved a festive procession in which three <i>mikoshi</i> 神輿, or portable shrines, were carried to the sea and dipped in to ensure protection for the fishermen who lived on the island. The procession can be seen in the background. The banner in the foreground reads <i>Sumiyoshi Daimyōjin</i> 住吉大明神, a collective name for the deities enshrined at the site.

In the creation of landscapes that lyrically portray the setting as well as the everyday lives of the local people, Hiroshige is unsurpassed. Most of his works depict contemporary Edo, where he was born, lived and worked.

This print shows people caught in a sudden evening rain. A woman who looks like a geisha is seen hurrying over the new bridge. A lonely craftsman on the Sumida River is getting drenched. The houses on the opposite bank are almost lost in the gray blur of the rain. Depicted from above, they lend depth to the picture. It was a new departure in woodblock-print design to depict a bridge from the side, spanning a large area of the picture from left to right, and giving the impression that the whole picture was expanding. The rain is depicted as long streaks, bursting suddenly from the black clouds in an expression of strength. Hiroshige masterfully captured the beauty of nature in rain on a summer evening."

On the right are the towers of the three theaters, <i>Moritaza</i>, <i>Ichimuraza</i>, and <i>Nakamuraza</i>. Shadows were another Western art convention that had begun to appear in Japanese art at this time."

(27.5 × 39.4 cm),Black and white drawing of park with colonnade structure in background and a group of people in the foreground. nature; leisure; classic architecture; rococo,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"Jean-Honoré Fragonard studied painting with Jean- Baptiste-Siméon Chardin  and François Boucher  and later in life became well known among collectors for his light-hearted mythological, romantic, and decorative paintings, which came to exemplify the Rococo style. 
<br><br>
This drawing, in which abundant vegetation overshadows the architecture of a parklike setting, is based on Fragonard's experience of Italian gardens during his stay in Rome in 1756-61. In the summer of 1760, he was the guest of the amateur artist and collector the Abbé de Saint-Non at the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, near Rome, famous for its gardens since its construction in the sixteenth century. Fragonard made many red-chalk drawings there that summer, often using aspects of the gardens' complex architectural settings and overgrown greenery in later works. 
<br><br>
The artist built up a number of small, delicate strokes in black chalk to create the complicated composition seen here, in which the white paper lends a strong sense of natural light, while areas of dark wash provide atmospheric shading. The work is an imaginary view that draws on elements of Tivoli's gardens and many of the motifs seen here-the circular temple, the flanking stone lions, the three urns replete with foliage, and the trellised arbor-are found in other of his works. The two arched spaces covered by trellising and connected by a rectangular doorway recall the work of fellow artist Hubert Robert, with whom Fragonard worked at this time, as well as Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whom he also knew. 
<br><br>
The small figures enjoying the scenery- four by the basin and two lightly sketched under the right trellis-seem almost incidental. The real subject is the lush garden growth, and the discrete presence of a wheelbarrow at the right alludes to the constant upkeep such a location would have required. The drawing was in the collection of the poet and art collector the Comte de Montesquiou for years, with a presumed companion drawing of a similar scene, also entitled <I>View of a Park</I>, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Slits on sides.",Gift of Helen Rice Hollis (OC 1930),Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"For the rulers of China’s Qing dynasty (1644–1911), visual spectacle was used to demonstrate authority and legitimacy. The ruling elite lived in a lavish and sumptuous atmosphere decorated with the finest materials, their very clothing covered in a complex symbolic language that expressed both auspicious wishes and one’s rank at court. Many features of this stunning robe suggest that it was made for a member of the imperial family.
<BR><BR>
Dragons, the foremost icon of imperial rule, cavort in a sky filled with colorful clouds, auspicious objects, and lucky red bats. Other motifs place the wearer at the center of an ordered imperial cosmos: the stylized waves at the hem and on the sleeves are the eternal ocean, with rainbow-colored sacred mountain peaks rising from them into the sky above. The light brown color of this robe was usually reserved for members of the imperial clan outside of the immediate imperial family, who wore yellow.
<BR><BR> 
The style of this robe references the northern homeland and equestrian martial traditions of the Manchus, an ethnic group from Northeast Asia who made up the Qing imperial family. It has tapered sleeves, tight around the wrists then flaring out in “horsehoof cuffs,” features that kept the arms warm and hands covered when holding reins.

Frame: 32 × 38 1/2 × 3 in. (81.3 × 97.8 × 7.6 cm)",,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,English,,"Celebrated for his dramatic candlelit scenes of modern scientific subjects, notably <I>Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump</I> (1768; National Gallery, London), Joseph Wright of Derby is also known as a portraitist, history painter, and accomplished landscape artist. Wright's earliest known landscapes date from about 1772, shortly before he traveled to Italy from 1773 to 1775. Much of Wright's work captures natural phenomena in sublime or picturesque landscapes, or communicates a sense of spellbound awe and mystery. 
<br><br>
The River Dove, a tributary of the Trent, runs through a narrow valley of limestone gorges in Derbyshire, in the East Midlands of England. The area has attracted tourists for centuries-Byron, Tennyson, and Ruskin all praised its beauty. Eighteenth-century guidebooks, and in particular James Pilkington's <I>A View of the Present State of Derbyshire with an Account of its most remarkable Antiquities</I> (1789), appreciated Dovedale:

<blockquote>Justly celebrated for its wild and fantastic appearance .!.!. you are struck with rocks of the most singular and extraordinary shape. In some places, they are seen rising up to the perpendicular height of thirty or forty yards in the form of pyramids, or spires of churches and entirely detached from the sides of the vale. In other parts, they lean over the river, and seem to threaten immediate destruction to everyone who passes by them.</blockquote> 

The natural limestone feature of Tissington Spires (named for the nearby village), and the full moon reflecting on the waters below, are focal points of this quietly evocative landscape. Even today, Dovedale- now a protected National Nature Reserve- is one of the most-visited natural sites in all of Britain. 
<br><br>
Wright painted at least five different views of Dovedale, in which he explored its dramatic topographical effects at various times of the day. One painting recorded in Wright's account book-signed in the same manner as the Oberlin painting-is presumably its pendant: ""A View in Dove Dale Morn. Companion in Do. Moonlight 3 qrs sold to Ed Mundy Esqr., £31.10. each."" Although this entry is undated, it is almost certainly a reference to the AMAM painting being purchased from the artist by Edward Mundy, a member of the prominent Mundy family of Markeaton Hall, near Derby, who commissioned several portraits from the artist. 
<br><br>
A classic illustration of eighteenth-century England's ideas of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque, Wright's painting is used extensively in a wide range of Oberlin College courses in art, literature, history, and the sciences. The many interpretations and readings of the picture range from its rocky spires as expressions of romantic cathedrals to social commentary that notes that Derby-just beyond the peaceful valley seen here-was a major site of industrialized England's cotton mills, which irrevocably changed the landscape of the countryside.

(35.5 × 26 cm),,Friends of Art Fund,Japanese,Heian Period (794 - 1185),"In Japan, popular belief held that the year 1052 marked the beginning of mappō 末法, the degenerate Third Age of Buddhism, a 10,000-year period in which Buddhist teachings slowly disappear until they are revived by the next buddha, Maitreya, who begins a new cycle. Declining social order in Japan, culminating in the civil wars of the mid- to late 12th century, reinforced this idea. One consolation was belief in the Buddha Amida (Amitābha), who had created an alternate universe in which the believer could be reborn, the Land of Bliss (Sukhāvatī), where all things were perfect and designed to lead one to complete enlightenment.<br>
<br>
This rare, early print bears multiple woodblock-printed images of Amida Buddha. Applied by a lay believer or monk, this act reflects the devotional practice of repeating acts of merit, often verbal or mental; here the technique results in a kind of visual prayer for salvation. Such prints were sometimes collected and placed within sculptural icons, both further consecrating the statue and cementing the printer’s spiritual connection with the deity.

He typically made statuettes of people engaged in everyday activities that evoked nostalgia for a simpler time.

Sculptures like this one would have been displayed in 19th-century homes, functioning as a moral guide and demonstrating cultural literacy.

Created in the years just following the Civil War, this figure of a man watching children play would have resonated strongly with viewers who had experienced the loss of a loved one or the uncertainty of returning home after war.

The famous Parisian tailor Humann commissioned Gavarni not only to draw his impeccable men’s suits for the fashion press, but also to wear them out on the town as advertisements to fellow dandies.

At lower left are prelates and other men representing the Catholic Church, while at lower right-Christ's ""sinister,"" or left, side-is the defeated Synagogue, representative of the Old Testament overthrown by the New. The Hebrew inscriptions on the work, from the book of Psalms, make reference to bread and wine (interpreted as precursors to the bread and wine symbolized by Christ's body and blood); the Latin text is from the Song of Solomon, which refers to a ""fountain of the gardens, well of living waters."" 
<br><br>
This brightly colored, crisply executed painting was made in Spain, as indicated by its combination of pinewood panel and gypsum ground, as opposed to the oak wood and chalk ground used in the Netherlands. The work is related to an earlier painting attributed to Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck and his workshop that was donated by Henry IV of Castile to the Monastery of El Parral in Segovia in 1455 and is now in the Museo Nacional del Prado. Another version of the painting, dated around 1560, is in Segovia Cathedral.

The AMAM painting has heraldry at the top of the panel that identifies its patron as García de Loaysa y Girón (1534-1599), archbishop of Toledo and tutor of the future King Philip III. By the late 18th century, the painting was likely in Palencia Cathedral, where it was documented by Antonio Ponz (1725-1792).

Frame: 54 1/2 × 66 3/8 × 1 3/4 in. (138.4 × 168.6 × 4.4 cm)",,R. T.

This major painting, <I>The Plough and the Song</I>, is one of five painted versions of the theme, two of which were destroyed in a fire in 1946. The painting, thinly done and with the use of turpentine to further thin the pigment, gives a great sense of transparency and light in relation to the other surviving versions (in the Art Institute of Chicago, and a private collection). The AMAM also has a preparatory drawing of 1944, one of three known of the same theme (others are in the National Gallery of Art and the Harvard Art Museum). The drawing was part of the artist's initial explorations of landscape, the first since his arrival in the United States twenty years before. 
<br><br>
Both the drawing and the painting speak to Gorky's nostalgia for his childhood home in Armenia-its countryside, gardens, and fields-and for his parents. In December 1944, he wrote his sister that he had carved a wooden plough as gift to his nephew, mentioning the ""fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows."" Gorky saw the plough as his birthright from his father, who had worked the fertile Armenian land, and the ""song"" as symbolic of his mother, who had taught him to love religious and folk songs before dying of starvation in 1919, during the Armenian genocide. The title is also reminiscent of the ploughing songs that workers sang in the fields to control the oxen. 
<br><br>
While individual forms in both works can be hard to discern, a study of all of the known versions of both painting and drawing, as well as other Gorky compositions, points toward a vertical figure at left and a female torso at upper right (both of which appear as mere smudges in the ethereal Oberlin painting), as well as a toppled haystack, ploughs, and flowers.

He was murdered on December 29, 1170, in Canterbury Cathedral, by knights of King Henry II after years of disagreement with the king; he was canonized in 1173. Becket was especially venerated in England and France in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, and most of the known chasses can be dated between 1195 and 1220. On this work, Saint Thomas turns from the altar to confront two assailants, one of whom strikes his head with a sword. In the panel above, his body is placed in a tomb by kneeling figures, while an archbishop, holding a crozier, gives a blessing. The treelike elements that flank the burial group are unusual and are found on only one other chasse; on other Limoges enamels, they signify an event that takes place outside, although the saint was buried in the cathedral's crypt.
<br><br>
In the technique of champlevé enamel, the ground glass colors fill cells that are recessed into a metal plate. Limoges, in central France, was famous for this type of work from the twelfth century on, producing thousands of reliquaries, crosses, and other ecclesiastical and secular works.

Kollwitz's ability to create formally complex compositions can be seen in the three-figure struggle between mother, child, and the skeleton, which personifies Death. One of the many graphic works that address maternal grief over the loss of a child, Death and the Mother eerily foreshadows the death of Kollwitz's own son in World War I. Like Munch before her, Kollwitz's depictions of mothers and children were a shocking contrast to the traditional, nostalgic portrayals popular at the turn of the century."

St. Francis kneels in prayer under a tree near the center of the print. A large crucifix appears before him. At right, another friar.",R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Dutch,,"Throughout his long career, Rembrandt produced more than three hundred prints, developing a technique so varied and intricate that he is universally recognized as revolutionizing printmaking as an art form.  
<br><br>
Dating to late in the artist's career, Rembrandt's <I>Saint Francis Beneath a Tree Praying</I> is known in two states. The first state, of which only about five rare impressions are extant, was executed in pure drypoint. In the second state, including Oberlin's impression, Rembrandt used the etching needle to fill in landscape details and make additions to the figure of Saint Francis. He also added a large signature and date at the lower right. Before this impression was printed, Rembrandt wiped the plate clean, intensifying the richness of the freely drawn drypoint lines. 
<br><br>
This impression shows Rembrandt's masterful handling of a subject unique in his printed oeuvre: Saint Francis immersed in prayer within a compressed landscape. Densely etched lines are powerfully woven together to heighten the impact of the crucifix, the large foreground tree, and the intricate canopy of foliage. The complexity of the carefully delineated right-hand landscape gives way on the left to rich drypoint lines scratched with a stylus directly onto the copperplate. Weaving freely over the plate, the sketchy quality of the drypoint allows the untouched white areas of the paper to illuminate and open up the forest area. 
<br><br>
Oberlin's impression of <I>Saint Francis</I> has an impressive history of ownership. It was formerly in the collection of Heneage Finch, fifth earl of Aylesford (1786-1859), and is by tradition referenced as having belonged to John Heywood Hawkins, M.P. (1803-1877) before being sold to Walter Francis, fifth duke of Buccleuch (1806-1884), all of these men being important collectors of Rembrandt etchings.

At the time, he settled briefly at Penarth, near Cardiff, Wales. There he painted several views of the country side and seacoast. Sisley considered a flexible application of paint to be essential in creating an Impressionist picture. In this example, he has employed a variety of painterly gestures. For the grass on the cliff tops, the strokes are short and fairly even, while the beach below displays elongated brushwork. The water and open sea are painted looser yet, with long sweeping strokes for the approaching waves.

Realism is portrayed as a working-class underdog—his rustic clogs, disheveled, ill-fitting clothes, and short, stocky physique contrast sharply with the athletic nakedness of his rival Idealism. Realism’s small, square palette and clumsy paintbrush seem to be no match for Idealism’s long, uplifted maulstick (used to steady a paintbrush) and great, oval-shaped palette-shield. And yet, Realism’s low center of gravity and determined expression suggest that these forces are not as mis-matched as they may at first appear. The fact that Idealism may be losing his touch (and his relevance) is suggested by his old man’s face and the round spectacles he wears—so at odds with his classically well-proportioned body."

The dimensions of this canvas are slightly off-kilter because Weenix designed it to fit the exact measurements of a 17th-century palace interior.

As the photographer Arnold Genthe wrote of Duncan in 1950, ""Her idea was not to be a Greek dancer, but to use the Greek dancing legend handed down in statue, frieze and painted vase as an inspiration for a play of rhythmic motion and gesture that would have grace and beauty and freedom, synchronizing the body and spirit of the modern woman and making it the implement of a great plastic art.""

In Schongauer’s representation, the Holy Family wanders through a land decidedly different from what the artist would have encountered in his native Germany. His penchant for incorporating a scintillating amount of detail has allowed scholars to identify the tree at left as a specific type—a rare Canarian dragon tree—native to the Iberian peninsula. Whether the artist traveled to the region remains an open question, but his inclusion of the extraordinary specimen in this rendering points to his attempt to provide authentic details for a distant landscape he had never seen.

One of Charles-Émile Jacque’s many vignette-style scenes of French agrarian life, this print captures a moment of shared peace and leisure amid the otherwise busy and strenuous work of farming. Loosely etched, the image has an ephemeral quality; its composition feels transient and gentle, like the moment it depicts.<br>
<br>
By depicting a moment of rest, Jacque expands the visual vocabulary of agrarianism. Here, the landscape functions not only as a source of food and capital for its inhabitants, but also as a place of refuge. Amid the rapid industrialization of the 19th century, Jacque’s print recalls a simpler, slower-paced life.

It is consistent with the works Klee created during the war, which were luminous with color, often describing mysterious forests or gardens. The composition displays the intricate layering and mounting of paper and careful application of paint typical of Klee's artistic process. Its poetic forms and structuring of color can also be attributed to French avant-garde artists like Delaunay. Klee opposed the war but was less outspoken than many of his contemporaries.

Miller Jr. Fund,Dutch,,"This work-one of the most important Northern Baroque paintings in the United States-is a strikingly sensitive vision of physical suffering. The third-century Saint Sebastian, shot with arrows by his fellow guardsmen for having converted to Christianity, was tended by the Roman widow Irene and her maidservant; none of the arrows had pierced a vital organ and they were able to bring him back to health. Here, left for dead, with his now gray, bloodless arm tied by a leather strap to a tree, he slumps forward as the women, fully absorbed in their work, tenderly begin to nurse him. 
<br><br>
Saint Sebastian was invoked against the plague; one that struck Utrecht, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam in 1624 may have helped to occasion the present work. For the upright composition, Ter Brugghen was likely inspired by Caravaggio's <I>Deposition</I>, as well as by a lost work by his compatriot, Baburen. Ter Brugghen was the only one of the Utrecht Caravaggisti-Dutch artists from Utrecht active in Rome, influenced by the works of Italian artist Caravaggio- to live in Rome in the early years of the seventeenth century, during Caravaggio's activity there. 
<br><br>
In Oberlin's work, the three figures are tightly massed in a monumental pyramidal composition whose strong diagonals, shallow space, and scale heighten its emotive power. The richness of the painting's cool chiaroscuro-the play of light and shadow over its three figures-is contrasted with the orange glow of the setting sun over the distant, desolate landscape in the background, over which black birds fly. 
<br><br>
Pierre Rosenberg, former director of the Louvre, published the painting in 2006 in his book <I>Only in America: One Hundred Paintings in American Museums Unmatched in European Collections</I>. Having conducted a survey of curators and art historians, Oberlin's painting was found to be cited more often than any other as meeting that extremely high standard-and, as a result, it is the book's front cover image. The AMAM owes its purchase to the connoisseurship of the museum's former director Charles Parkhurst, who first saw the work at a dealer in New York in the spring of 1953. After discussion with Oberlin art professor Wolfgang Stechow, he agreed to move forward on the purchase. The dealer was then in touch with Samuel Kress, for whom it had been reserved, to gain his approval. The painting might equally have gone when it was earlier in the hands of another dealer to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam or to the museum in Utrecht. The Rijksmuseum, however, did not have available dollar funds while the Utrecht museum did not act quickly enough, due in part to a misdirected letter. 
<br><br>
Ter Brugghen first studied with the artist Abraham Bloemaert before leaving the Netherlands for Italy. Upon his return to Utrecht he painted both religious and genre subjects, such as flute and lute players, and allegories, and was praised above all other Utrecht artists by the great painter Rubens on the latter's trip to that city in 1627.

Added to these atmospheric effects is the artist's trademark pale green light that fills the open spaces of the composition.

Spingold,French,,"In this painting, the changeability and luminosity of the dying sun on the French Mediterranean coast is brilliantly depicted by Henri-Edmond Cross, a Neo-Impressionist painter whose divisionist style recalls works by his better-known compatriots Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. As a young painter, Cross favored darker, more somber colors, but after contact with Impressionist artists, his palette changed to lighter, brighter tones. 
<br><br>
<I>The Return of the Fisherman</I> depicts a rocky inlet close by the village of Saint- Clair, where Cross made his home, near Saint-Tropez; here, the surf rolls in, bashing against the line of rocky outcroppings known as ""Les Baleines"" (""The Whales""), and sends up a plume of spray, as seen in the background at the far left of the canvas. A barefoot man, carrying a large jug on his shoulder, strides forward, and further along the winding path, two small figures make their way homeward. The clouds are backlit by the sun, which has fallen below the cliff, encircling it in a brilliant line of brightness. At the upper left, small blue strokes of paint begin to invade the canvas, heralding the coming dusk. Two drawings for the work are known, and Cross included a small color sketch of it in a letter he wrote to Signac in the fall of 1896. 
<br><br>
The year after it was made, Oberlin's painting was shown at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (a group Cross helped found along with Seurat and Signac in 1884) in Paris.

The composition is two-dimensional with the figures placed above each other to suggest depth, some turned at angles to offer the most interesting profile or silhouette.  Tapestries of this moderate size were usually woven in sets, and used to divide large halls into smaller sections or chambers."

Shadows are cast everywhere, even on the side of the inner frame where the light falls on the left (though the light source in the central scene is on the right)."

Asselijn's subject matter was diverse, ranging from views of the Italian countryside to scenes of everyday life in Rome. In his landscape drawings, he was particularly interested in architectural ruins. The large ruin at the left is the Nymphaeum Hortorum Licianorum, although it was known (and wrongly identified) as the Temple of Minerva Medica in the 17th century.

The drawing has been pricked for transfer; it is also one of the few known pricked Renaissance drawings for which the corresponding panel painting, part of the predella to an altarpiece (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) survives. Pricking consists of making small pinprick holes along the outlines of a preparatory drawing. The drawing was then overlaid on a surface such as a panel, wall, or canvas, and a powder-often pulverized charcoal- was dusted over it, penetrating the holes. The traces of charcoal left on the surface of the panel or other support supplied the outlines used in painting the final version of the work. 
<br><br>
The influence of Leonardo da Vinci in this work is strongly felt, particularly in the psychological intensity, exquisite modeling, and dramatic chiaroscuro. Evidence of reworking can be seen in the angels' wings and Christ's hands; the artist once intended to show the spear that pierced Christ's side more prominently. Christ's frontal position and the symmetrically placed angels give the drawing a monumental character far removed from its actual size.

From 1608–10, Goudt was in Rome, where he met the German painter Adam Elsheimer, whose paintings of nocturnal scenes on copper were innovative and rare. Goudt’s engravings after Elsheimer’s works, such as this one, popularized his work, making him highly influential for subsequent generations of artists.

(21.7 × 38 × 47 cm),"Document box and tray decorated with a falcon, chrysanthemum, and other birds and flowers. Wood, laquer, and gold",Gift of Norbert Schimmel,Japanese,Edo-Meiji Periods (1615 - 1912),"Asian lacquer is derived from the sap of the tree <I>rhus vernicuflua</I>. When refined, brushed onto another surface, and allowed to dry, it creates a highly durable finish that protects objects against damage from extreme temperatures, humidity, and insects. Primitive lacquering was known in Japan as early as the third century BC, but it did not emerge as a significant art form there until around the eighth century AD. Japanese lacquer artists soon developed several distinctive styles and techniques of lacquer decoration. One important decorative technique-called <I>maki-e</I>-involved sprinkling powdered gold, silver, and copper onto the wet lacquer to create elaborate pictorial images. Depending on how the metallic powders were applied, the images could appear under the lacquer surface, flush with the surface, or raised in relief above it. All three types of <I>maki-e</I> are used to masterful effect on this fine document box. 
<br><br>
The box consists of three pieces: a bottom, a lid, and an interior tray. It was made to store important papers and other small valuables that needed special protection from light, damp, and vermin. The exterior of the box is decorated with an image of a trained falcon perched on a stand. As in Europe, falconry was an elite hobby in Japan that was historically practiced mainly by members of the samurai warrior class. Although the samurai class was officially abolished in 1868, imagery associated with it remained popular in Japan well into the twentieth century. 
<br><br>
Raw lacquer is highly toxic and must be applied slowly and with great care; each coat of lacquer must be fully dry before the next can be applied. A box like this required dozens of coats of lacquer and would have taken weeks or even months of intermittent labor to complete. The high cost of the labor and materials, combined with the falcon design, make this box a potent symbol of wealth and power that still impresses viewers today.

Working together, they created soaring frescoes on mythological, religious, and historical subjects but also works that sensitively reflected the costumes, activities, and pleasures of daily life. 
<br><br>
This is one of 104 drawings Tiepolo created in a series entitled <I>Divertimento per li regazzi (Entertainment for Children)</I>, illustrating the adventures of Punchinello, a stock character in the Italian <I>commedia dell'arte</I>. Depicted as a hunchback wearing a mask with beaked nose, cylindrical hat, and white clothing, the character was an inveterate trickster. In this scene, Punchinello closely examines the wing and underside of a large ostrich, while two smaller ostriches enter from the left. A group of wealthy onlookers dressed in sixteenth-century costume stand near a statue of Ganymede, who is accompanied by his attribute, an eagle. Ganymede- renowned for his beauty and his association with high art-makes a marked contrast to the ""low art"" of Punchinello, who is descended from a chicken or turkey, and here consorts with a bird known for its bizarre appearance. 
<br><br>
The simultaneous fluency and tremulousness of Tiepolo's line impart vivacity and movement, and his use of the brightness of the sheet in creating highlights provides a marvelous counterpoint to his rich, brown wash.

The glowing colors show the influence of the Fauves, while the heavy, dark outlines recall the work of Paul Gauguin. Jawlensky spent the summer of 1911 on the Baltic in Prerow (Pomerania). In 1937, he recalled this period, “This summer meant for me a great development in my art. There I painted… large figural works… in very strong, glowing colors and not at all naturalistic or objective. I used a great deal of red, blue, orange, cadmium yellow and chromium oxide green. My forms were very strongly colored in Prussian blue and came with tremendous power from an inner ecstasy.... It was a turning point in my art. It was in these years, up to 1914 just before the war, that I painted my most powerful works.”"

Miller Jr. Fund,German,,"The roughly carved edges of this work call to mind both African sculpture and the enigmatic figure in the background of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's <I>Self-Portrait as a Soldier</I> in the AMAM collection; it is also highly reminiscent of the artist's woodcuts. Kirchner had begun sculpting in wood around 1911, after studying African, Pacific Island, and Indian sculpture. The work has traditionally been dated to 1919, when Kirchner was living near Davos, Switzerland, after the trauma of the First World War. 
<br><br>
Prior to the AMAM purchase of it, <I>Standing Female Nude</I> was twice exhibited in 1952 as ""Eva,"" a reference to the biblical Eve, for the figure's unabashed nudity. Although the artist was sculpting figures of Adam and Eve for either side of a door for his home in Switzerland in 1921, and created many other works with that theme, it is not known to be original to the Oberlin sculpture. When Kirchner published the work that same year in an article he wrote under his pseudonym ""L. de Marsalle,"" he simply titled it ""Stehendes Mädchen"" (""Standing Girl""). The artist's wife, Erna, likely served as model. 
<br><br>
The sculpture's expressive pose-one shoulder hunched up, the other pushed down, with one hand on a hip and one on the chest-brings out its energy and tension, the result of fitting the figure into what was a narrow block of wood. In 1911, Kirchner had written of woodcarving that ""it is so good for painting and drawing, this making of figures, it lends wholeness to drawing and is such a sensual pleasure when blow by blow the figure grows more and more from the trunk. There is a figure in every trunk, one must only peel it out.""

Mold marks visible on back of right leg, right and left buttocks, upper back and right front leg.",R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"Auguste Rodin is arguably one of the most influential artists of the modern age, and produced a vast array of sculptures in plaster, marble, and bronze, as well as many drawings. His works are known for championing the ruggedness, strength, and materiality of the human body and the powerful emotions to which it is subject. Rodin was awarded numerous public commissions in France in the late nineteenth century, and took up subjects ranging from portraits of notable men, such as the writer Honoré de Balzac, to those inspired from biblical or classical events. 
<br><br>
This powerfully emotional work displays the vulnerability of its protagonist, a young man who kneels on a massive rock, torso uncomfortably angled, head thrown back and arms outstretched. His face, with open mouth, is similar to that in numerous other works by the artist that express sorrow, longing, or fear. The prodigal son, from a biblical parable, leaves his family and returns destitute, pleading for mercy and forgiveness. His despair, energy, and pentup feelings are fully expressed in Rodin's work. 
<br><br>
The figure was created by Rodin for inclusion in the late 1880s in his monumental <I>Gates of Hell</I>; he appears twice in the right panel, both vertically and horizontally as part of a group with a female body, later reworked by the artist as the <I>Fugit Amor</I> group, and symbolic of the disillusionment and pain of dying love. Neither group is present in an April 1887 photograph of the plaster model for the Gates, but a freestanding <I>Fugit Amor</I> was exhibited in plaster in Paris in 1887; therefore, the initial conception for the group, and Oberlin's male figure, probably dates to that year. As he did with other figures from the <I>Gates</I>, Rodin enlarged, modified, and reused a single figure from his initial idea to create a monumental work, as is the case for <I>The Prodigal Son</I>.

(37.5 cm),,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"This small bronze is related in its form and posture to Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas's <I>Little Dancer Aged Fourteen</I> (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), originally made in wax and exhibited in 1881 with a gauze tutu, hair wig, and colored ribbons. It was the only sculptural work the artist publicly exhibited and was subsequently created in bronze in over twenty-five casts; it is also known in two plaster variants. <I>Little Dancer</I>'s daring realism and use of unorthodox materials situate it as a lynchpin within Degas's oeuvre, and as a precursor to twentieth-century sculpture. 
<br><br>
Oberlin's work, <I>Dancer at Rest</I>, while much smaller and without the costume and realistic elements of <I>Little Dancer</I>, is evidence of the artist's grappling with the same formal and expressive challenges that faced him in that wax sculpture. He shows a ballet ""rat""-a young girl of lower-class origins-unsentimentally; she thrusts her chin, lower lip, and left leg forward and stands with both hands at her hips, in a way that could be construed as confrontational or impertinent. The Oberlin work appears somewhat more informal than <I>Little Dancer</I> and less like a traditional ballet pose; here too, the girl's hands are separated and not joined as they were in those of the 1881 wax. 
<br><br>
Degas scholars have seen in Oberlin's sculpture the most convincing candidate for a ""missing link"" between Degas's early equestrian works and the maturity of <I>Little Dancer Aged Fourteen</I>. As Richard Kendall has noted, the Oberlin work

<blockquote>has none of the sinuousness or acrobatic complexity of the waxes from later years . . . its surface shows extensive working with a toothed modeling implement of a kind used on the 1881 wax and . . . it has a distinctive anatomical vagueness around the breast, waist, and hips that would be consistent with an early trial with reduced scale clothing . . .</blockquote>

Miller Jr. Fund,Spanish,,"Although he worked primarily in painting, Pablo Picasso is also celebrated for his sculptures, ceramics, and works in other media. He was one of the originators of Cubism, along with Georges Braque, but during his long life, Picasso worked in numerous styles, each of which was highly influential on his contemporaries. 
<br><br>
Fernande Olivier lived with Picasso from 1904 to 1911. The artist made this bust early during that time, in what is known as his ""Rose Period,"" when he produced a small number of sculptures. The terra-cotta model for the work was probably made a few years before it was cast in bronze under the auspices of the artist's dealer, Ambroise Vollard. The AMAM sculpture is one of this early set of casts, signed by the artist; subsequent unsigned casts were made in 1959. 
<br><br>
The work is evidence of Picasso's interest in mass and form. The depiction is asymmetrical, with the sitter's proper left side more fully finished; her right eye is only lightly outlined. In 1907, Picasso explored the treatment of women-and asymmetry in their depictions-more fully in his seminal <I>Demoiselles d'Avignon</I> painting. By 1908, the artist had moved into his early Cubist phase that would last until the 1920s. He created another cubist sculptural portrait of Fernande in 1909, which exists in numerous bronze versions.

The AMAM collection contains over forty works by Picasso; in addition to numerous prints, the present sculpture, and two paintings, there are four drawings represented.

Wee masks are often used in ceremonies such as the annual sowing and harvesting of rice when masqueraders gather for festivals intended to ensure prosperity. Possessing enormous spiritual powers to detect and prevent sorcery, these masks are also used in connection with burials, funerals, and initiation ceremonies. 
<br><br>
Forest spirits appear to humans in dreams and choose to be represented through male or female masks. Male masks-generally more aggressive in appearance, with geometric patterns, tusks, horns, and bullet cartridges-are considered more important than female masks. The beautiful and refined oval AMAM mask is serene in appearance, with its vertical scarification pattern, kaolin-covered eyes, and full mouth surrounded by braided human hair, bells, and striking blue glass beads. Many of these components incorporate empowering materials that invest the mask with supernatural force. The curved cheek mark, a characteristic that only appears on female masks, is clearly delineated here. A hook on the top of the mask and hooks along the lower edge were added in order to attach a conical cloth-covered headdress. A raffia skirt covering the dancer's upper leg would have completed the costume.

The Oberlin icon collapses the birth of Christ, the Annunciation to the Shepherds, and the Adoration of the Magi into a single image. In the center, a recumbent Mary and the Christ Child, accompanied by an ox and a horse, occupy a dark cave inside a mountain. To their left, an angel announces the arrival of Christ to a shepherd, while to the right, the three Magi approach, the Star of Bethlehem guiding them with three rays of light.
<br><br>
The lower portion of the image contains two scenes transmitted through apocryphal stories: Joseph tempted by the devil in the guise of an old and bent shepherd and the bath of the Christ Child as related in the Gospels of Pseudo-Matthew and Pseudo-James. According to apocryphal texts, the devil, sensing Joseph’s doubts, told him that a virgin birth is not possible. The icon’s inclusion of these non-canonical accounts reinforces, on the one hand, Christ’s divinity manifest in his immaculate conception and, on the other, his humanity evident in his bath, customary for any newborn baby."

He became known for the elongated faces and torsos of his sitters, and worked in both sculpture and painting, creating portraits of the many artists and writers who made Montmartre and Montparnasse their homes in the early years of the twentieth century. 
<br><br>
This painting is among the more than two dozen female nudes Modigliani created in the last years of his life. It originally bore an inscription, ""Modigliani / 3 Joseph Bara / Paris / 1917,"" indicating that it was among the works painted at the home of Modigliani's dealer, Léopold Zborowski, where the artist lived, worked, and was supplied with models and materials during 1917. His nudes are indebted to those of Titian and Giorgione, as well as Goya and Manet, but filtered through the artist's stylization of face and body, and absent many indi cations of setting. 
<br><br>
In December 1917, Modigliani had his first and only one-man exhibition, organized by Zborowski and held at the Galerie Berthe Weill in Paris. It is not known whether the present work was in the exhibition, but it is extremely likely, as Zborowski owned it at the time. The police closed the show, as a handful of nudes on display were found to be obscene. Despite the artist's reductive, stylized forms, the depiction of nipples and pubic hair-as in this work, where the model boldly touches her genital area-certainly contributed to this sense of contemporary outrage and shock. 
<br><br>
The work was once owned by the Parisian art critic, salesman, and anarchist Félix Fénéon, and was sold by the art dealer Pierre Matisse in 1950 to Joseph and Enid Bissett, who made their fortune through development of the Maidenform bra.

This unfinished leaf provides great insight into an illuminator’s working method. The ruling, text, and music came first; these are completely finished, and allowed the manuscript to be bound and used even though its decoration was incomplete. John, on the other hand, is only outlined in pen. The artist went one step further with the monkey hanging on the letter “F” and the small boy in the border, first drawing them and then adding an initial base color. In contrast, the beautiful bird in the border is completely finished.

(38 × 27.8 cm),,Gift of Mr. Joseph Cantor,Cuban,,"Ranging from the Cuban Baroque to Art Deco, the eclectic architecture of Old Havana served as a source of artistic inspiration for René Portocarrero. Made at the height of his most abstract period, <I>Señales No. 2</I> features black, crisscrossed lines that evoke wrought-iron gates and lattices, while planes of color suggest stained glass windows. Known for his vibrant use of color, here Portocarrero mutes his palette with tempera washes in green, brown, and blue, accented by areas of highly saturated lemon yellow and earthy red.
<BR><BR>
The composition is a complex configuration of spirals, triangles, circles, dots, hatchmarks, and parallel lines. Despite the emphasis on geometry, the arrangement reads as an upright totemic figure: a triangular head punctuated by two eyes is discernible at top center. Portocarrero often constructed human forms from geometric shapes, particularly triangles. The figure in this work may relate to Portocarrero’s representations of Caribbean popular and religious practices, such as Carnival or Afro-Cuban traditions. The latter was also an interest of fellow Cuban artist Wifredo Lam.

Twenty-three of these come from his <i>Apocalypse</i> series, which illustrate scenes from the final book of the New Testament, <i>St. John's Revelations</i>. In this print Duvet depicts the scene that opens the Revelations chapter, where Christ appears to St. John amidst seven candlesticks, signifying the seven churches of early Christianity. The trumpet stretching from Christ’s hand to John’s ear illustrates the passage, “I was in the Spirit of the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet.”

Though based on a similar series by Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), Duvet's prints feature a more densely packed, almost ornamental style. The weighty and classicized figures show the influence of Italian artists like Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-ca. 1534)."

It was initially practiced by monk-painters active in the major Zen temples, but was also appreciated by the secular military elites who ruled Japan at that time. This Japanese scroll closely follows Chinese models. It depicts a mountainous landscape that is sharply defined in the foreground and becomes less distinct in the distance. Evidence of human civilization is visible but is dwarfed by the majestic natural forms. The composition is heavily weighted to one side, and large expanses of empty space give the image an evocative, lyrical quality. Indeed, the scroll belongs to a larger tradition of Chinese and Japanese paintings that were considered to be ""poems without sound"" and were intended to stimulate the viewer's imagination more than to portray a physical place. 
<br><br>
An old seal in one corner of the painting attributes it to a famous monk-painter named Oguri S otan (1413-1481). Genuine Sotan paintings are rare, however, and it is doubtful that this scroll is actually from his hand. But it is most likely from the same period, and may have been the model for a similar painting ascribed to the monk Gakuo (active ca. 1504-1520) that is now in the Tokyo National Museum. Oberlin purchased this scroll from Cleveland-based dealer Howard Hollis in 1956 on the advice of Sherman Lee, a distinguished scholar who was then Curator of Oriental Art at the Cleveland Museum of Art and later became its director. Lee advised the AMAM on a number of Asian art purchases in the 1950s and '60s that greatly expanded and improved that part of the museum's collection.

Sheet: 17 3/4 × 22 1/16 in. (45.1 × 56.1 cm)",,Friends of Art Fund,American,,"One of the leaders of Abstract Expressionism in New York, Willem de Kooning was born in Rotterdam, where he attended art school and worked as a commercial artist. At the age of twenty-two, he stowed away on a New York-bound ship and soon encountered many artists of the avant-garde, including John Graham, Arshile Gorky, and Stuart Davis. 
<br><br>
In 1938, De Kooning met twenty-year-old fellow artist Elaine Fried, whom he would marry five years later, and began working on his <I>Women</I> series. The fragmentation, eroticism, and gestural immediacy of those works continued in the 1950s with his second Women series. In 1952, De Kooning completed his iconic <I>Woman I</I> (Museum of Modern Art, New York), on which he worked for two years. This painting, along with five other versions of the subject, was exhibited in De Kooning's third one-man show at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in March 1953, where both critics and the public were offended by what they perceived as its violence and sexism. 
<br><br>
At the same time De Kooning was working on his <I>Woman</I> paintings of 1950-52, he made many drawings exploring the same theme-indeed, drawing was always integral to De Kooning's painting. Some of these drawings he even attached to his canvases and painted over, expressing the interconnectedness between his works in different media. In the summer of 1952, while at his summer home in Easthampton, New York, De Kooning made dozens of pastels. Many, like the AMAM drawing, represent two standing women and look back to an early stage of <I>Woman I</I>. The origins of that painting included a seven-foot- high drawing of two women that De Kooning made on two sheets and attached to his wall; the drawing was destroyed as the painting developed. 
<br><br>
The energy and violence of De Kooning's draftsmanship is particularly strong in the AMAM drawing, which shows the artist exploring ways to express the essence of the figures' structure. The unlabored application of pastel, charcoal, and graphite suggests the speed with which De Kooning quickly captured a thought or impression before moving on to the next. The real subject of this sketch is the process of drawing itself. In the absence of other depictions of two women, a drawing like this one could also plausibly be read as one woman seen from the front and the back- perhaps suggesting a cinematographic mode. De Kooning explicitly integrated the color of the paper within the drawing to neutralize any background effect-just as he worked to make the backgrounds of his paintings into the vague, indefinite spaces he called ""no-environments.""

The bearded older man leans intimately over the woman’s shoulder to read from her song sheet.

Cradling her cheek in her right hand, Marie stares woefully into space, adopting a pose that has been interpreted historically as a sign of melancholy. Indeed, Marie exhibits a sense of wistful longing as she becomes lost in her thoughts. This print reflects Marie Laurencin’s characteristic style of the 1920s and 30s. During those decades she produced numerous female portraits, all of which are depicted with rounded contours and solid black eyes. They are also rendered using a selective color palette of pale blues, pinks, and greens. Laurencin’s particular aesthetic has been labeled feminine due to her use of soft forms and bright colors, which stands in marked contrast to the more angular shapes and neutral tones of the then-popular Cubist style."

The photographer Michael Sima had given him a small live owl as a gift-the bird was both the symbol of Antibes and of the goddess Athena-and Picasso proceeded to paint it in a number of works.

Encasing a dried piece of the newborn’s umbilical cord with milkweed and herbs inside the animal form protected it from harm, thus also protecting the child. The amulet would be placed around the child’s neck, or, more often, attached to the baby’s cradleboard as a toy.<br>

The Lakota and Sioux tribes frequently made their amulets in the shape of turtles, possibly because turtles have long lives and are difficult to kill (because of their thick shells). By creating amulets in this shape, the maker symbolically transferred to the child the qualities of those animals."

T. Miller Jr. Fund,Italian,,"Jacopo Ligozzi, the son of a family of painters and designers, was court artist to four successive Grand Dukes of Tuscany and was known both for his paintings and detailed drawings, as well as for his designs for decoration in <I>pietre dure</I>, or hardstones. The AMAM also possesses delicate studies of a camel and hedgehog by the artist. 
<br><br>
Ligozzi painted the scene of Christ on the <I>Mount of Olives (Agony in the Garden</I>) on copper as the centerpiece of this elaborate portable altar, as well as the tiny <I>Sacrifice of Isaac</I> below, on costly and precious lapis lazuli. He is also very likely responsible for the design of the overall altarpiece and its case, which would have been made along with the assistance of specialists working in <I>pietre dure</I>, from a Medici Grand Ducal workshop set up for that purpose in the sixteenth century. The altar, created from wood stained to look like ebony, also includes two gilt bronze columns inlaid with lapis lazuli and inlays of mother-of-pearl, agate, lapis, and semiprecious stones, as well as silver putti with gilded wings.
<br><br>
It is accompanied by its original carrying case, making this an exceptionally rare piece. The wooden case, painted with fictive lapis lazuli panels, displays an elaborate floral design-among his many talents, Ligozzi was a botanical illustrator-as well as a center cartouche with ""IHS,"" an abbreviation for ""Jesus"" and the monogram of the Jesuits, a cross, and a heart pierced with three nails, symbolic of those used in Christ's crucifixion. 
<br><br>
The central painting depicts Christ, immediately prior to his arrest, collapsing against an angel who gestures heavenwards in the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives. A chalice surmounted by a tiny cross appears on the outcropping behind them, bathed in a glowing pink and yellow light. Christ's limp arms, open mouth, and half-closed eyes are visual manifestations of his intense suffering, as he contemplates his impending death. In conformance with the biblical text about this moment, his sweat drops in tiny rivulets of blood. In the smaller painting below, an emulation of the predella of a larger altarpiece, the sacrificial fire burns as an angel stays Abraham's blow, while a tiny ram appears from the right, to take Isaac's place. Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son was considered a prefiguration of the crucifixion of Jesus. Here, the brilliant blues and whites of the lapis themselves form the sky.
<br><br>
Such an elaborate and precious object was likely made as a gift from the Medici court to a wealthy, noble (and still unidentified) family. The altar's provenance can only be traced to Vienna in the mid- twentieth century. Oberlin emeritus professor of art William Hood, noting its date of 1608, has posited that it might have been made as a gift from the Medici to the Hapsburgs in Vienna during marriage negotiations for Archduchess Maria Magdalena and the Medici eldest son and heir that summer (he succeeded his father the following year, as Cosimo II). The altar would have been used in a personal, domestic religious setting, and naturally would have been able to be carried in its case for use when traveling. The altar and case together are truly an exceptional set of works that unite painting, stonework, architecture, and sculpture into a magnificent whole, and speak to the use of luxury materials and private devotion in the early seventeenth century.

In addition, colors are categorized by brilliance, not by hue, and in this respect green is considered as radiant as the gold leaf or other gold embellishments that adorn sacred images.

This entire manuscript page, or folio, is a pastiche of an unrelated 16th century painting and texts assembled together in the 20th century.

Golden sky is not typical in Persian painting of the period, but the gold and the colors and style are characteristic of Central Asian painitngs in a Persianate style, probably from the Uzbek kingdom of Bukhara. The text on the verso relates to King Sulayman, and may have been selected as a verso to add to the painting, which probably represents King Sulayman, often shown enthroned with a flaming halo and shown with jinn and demons. The text of the recto, at the top and bottom of the painting, is completely unrelated: poems by the Persian poet Hafez (1325-1390).

Thick, viscous oil paint boldly applied gives the coarse texture of this work in which the artist has built up the composition using dark grounds, working from dark to light. The painting of the famous medieval castle of Chillon (once belonging to the Dukes of Savoy) overlooking Lake Geneva was probably painted on one of the artist's visits to La Tour-de-Peilz, situated a few miles from the lake. In 1873 Courbet took up residence in the town as an exile and produced several more pictures of this picturesque setting."

Pollock drew on one side of the support (which is printed on both sides with the same plate) in the vibrant primary colors of yellow, red, and blue in addition to black, leaving mostly clear the shape at upper right, emphasizing the outline of the winglike shape at top center, and shading in between and behind the leg- and armlike forms in the lower half of the work, as well as both vertical edges.

After 1919, he continued to make portraits but turned ever more toward landscapes and works based on historical or classical themes, maintaining the deep colors and intensity of paint application of his earlier years. 
<br><br>
This painting, titled with the Italian word for ""wedding,"" shows a couple who have been identified as the writer and critic Emil Alphonse Rheinhardt (1889- 1945) and his second wife, Elsa Romanic. In 1958, Kokoschka could himself no longer remember their names, writing to AMAM curator Chloe Hamilton that ""the real names of the young people I have forgotten and only remember having heard long afterwards that the man had been gassed and the girl died from starvation during the Russian occupation of a part of Austria. .!.!. You see a very sad fate befell my sitters as, unfortunately, most of my friends of that époque."" Kokoschka further wrote that he had given it the title ""Sposalizio"" because he understood that the couple intended to be married one day. (Both Rheinhardt and Elsa Romanic were depicted in drawings made by Kokoschka in 1912, and Rheinhardt did die in a concentration camp.) 
<br><br>
The painting formerly belonged to Mrs. Lotte Franzos (1881-1957), who held a salon in Vienna in the early twentieth century where artists, writers, and politicians would meet, and whom Kokoschka painted in 1909. He wrote of her after her death, ""She had meant a great deal in my life. And she remained loyal to my work, very different from many other people of my youth. I will always be grateful to her beyond death and especially that she left <I>Sposalizio</I> to the Oberlin Museum."" Her bequest to the AMAM included paintings by Anton Faistauer and Carl Moll, prints by Dürer and Rembrandt, and a Kokoschka drawing of a nude youth from about 1907.

Among his strongest works is an early series of small paintings and woodcuts he produced in the 1890s when he was looking to Gauguin for aesthetic leadership.

When studying the human figure, Kokoschka preferred to work with prepubescent children, writing that he sought out models that were as thin as possible, especially children who work in circuses “because you can see their joints, sinews and muscles so clearly, and because the effect of each movement is modelled more emphatically with them.” In this image, Kokoschka creates a contour drawing of a young girl whose gangly limbs evoke a sense of dynamism and potential for movement. While the figure assumes a pose that reads as adult, her slim hips and adolescent awkwardness reveal her young age.

<br>
Brown, dry, and eerily expansive, the depicted terrain lends the scene an apocalyptic tone—yet there is still a suggestion of hope. The woman drags a plow behind her, insinuating that she and her partner are in the midst of preparing the land for the spring crop. Vitalized, perhaps, by the prospect of growth, food, and wealth, the couple’s kiss may be read as an extension of their farm work. If the woman’s body is indeed a metaphor or surrogate for the land, then so are the kiss and plow symbols of fertilization. By depicting love, labor, and land as interdependent forces, Rops’s etching romanticizes peasant life.

<br><br>
The vibrant blue sky and expansive countryside of <I>Woman by a Large Window</I> are brought indoors, where a woman sits at a table with her back turned to a mirror that reflects the glowing abstract landscape beyond. The artist was careful to remove any details of her face or clothing that might express the sitter's personality. Like the luminous but generalized landscape beyond and behind her, she becomes an axis on the carefully composed grid that underlies Diebenkorn's construction of space. There is no action in this quiet painting-except for that which lays bare the painting process: the rich, almost tapestry-like quality of the woman's dress and the muted interior setting are alive with energetic brushstrokes, scratches, and paint splatters that are often visible in multiple layers of colors and tones.

While she was writing an article on Diebenkorn, Oberlin professor of art Ellen Johnson recalled in her memoirs that she corresponded with the artist, who generously gave her a pencil study for Oberlin's painting. Johnson also purchased for herself a large Diebenkorn painting, <I>Berkeley #42</I> (1955), which she loved. Eventually- after offering it first to the AMAM, which felt its Diebenkorn holdings were adequate- Johnson sold it to the Cleveland Museum of Art.

Prentiss Funds,Dutch,,"On this small surface, Dutch painter and printmaker Hercules Segers conjured a view of an expansive landscape, dark and craggy in the foreground, with a vast mountain range expanding into the distance. Employing a poetic combination of dark printed lines and freely applied watercolor washes, Segers's carefully composed valley harkens back to the masterful atmospheric landscapes popularized by such fifteenth- and sixteenth-century German and Netherlandish artists as Albrecht Altdorfer, Peter Bruegel the Elder, and Hendrick Goltzius. 
<br><br>
Only a handful of paintings firmly attributed to Segers are known today, contributing to the difficulty in establishing a precise chronology of the artist's oeuvre. Deter mining dates for Segers's etchings proves equally problematic, since he often reused plates and touched them up with watercolor washes at various times. A number of Segers's works were formerly owned by Rembrandt, who was captivated by the older master's purposeful blurring of boundaries between painting, drawing, and printmaking and was influenced by his use of colored inks and a variety of paper, often hand-colored, for dramatic effect. 
<br><br>
Approximately fifty-four different plates by Segers have been identified, with just over 180 impressions known today, including about twenty-one impressions of <I>The Enclosed Valley</I>. Oberlin's is the first state (of four) printed on linen fabric primed with white lead and dyed or toned a light brown. Dark areas of printed ink funnel seamlessly toward the deep mountain vista evoked through careful application of rich green and blue watercolor washes. 
<br><br>
Oberlin's Segers print has an important history of ownership that dates back to the early eighteenth century, when it was in the collection of printmaker Jacob Houbraken (1698-1780). Sometime between 1746 and 1756, architectural historian Karl Heinrich von Heineken obtained this impression for August III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony (1696-1763). Later, it entered the State Art Collection (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen), Dresden. In 1923, when the print was deaccessioned, it was acquired by the Dutch collector and connoisseur Frits Lugt (1884-1970), widely known for his seminal reference work<I>Les Marques de collections</I> (a manual of collector's marks that trace the provenance of works on paper) and for the Institut Néerlandais, the cultural foundation he and his wife established in Paris. Although the AMAM purchased the Segers print from a New York dealer, it is interesting to note that during World War II, Lugt temporarily relocated his family from the Netherlands to Oberlin, Ohio, in part because of his friendship with Oberlin professor of art Wolfgang Stechow."

A prolific draftsman, his works are known especially for their inventive com positions and energetic lines. 
<br><br>
Guercino created many works depicting Mars, the Roman god of war, either alone or with Cupid or Venus. This drawing, full of verve and movement, was made as a study for a painting, now lost, recorded in the artist's inventory after his death. Cupid, emblematic of love, attempts to restrain Mars from his destructive path. As his sword-arm is held back, Mars turns away and pushes forward, his other arm outstretched, fingers splayed and cloak billowing behind. In an engraving by Giacomo Giovannini (1667-1717) of what was presumably the final painting, Mars stands more upright, holding his cloak together with his left arm, while a battle rages in the background. The rapid, spontaneous strokes with which the drawing was executed and numerous small changes in the positions of the figures' limbs heighten the dramatic tension and give the viewer the impression that he is present in the very midst of its creation.

Although the erotic nature of much of Klimt's art garnered him numerous unfavorable reviews, his works today are appreciated for their mixture of often sensuous themes and striking use of gold and silver leaf and other precious materials alongside areas of bright color. 
<br><br>
Between 1896 and 1898, Klimt created numerous portrait drawings as independent works of art, most of which depict the sitter in profile. In March 1898, he exhibited this drawing of an elegant woman-one of his very few works in pastel-in the first Vienna Secession exhibition and published it in the group's avant-garde journal <I>Ver Sacrum (Sacred Spring)</I>. The sitter's parted lips (revealing small white teeth), rosy cheek, and thick hair pulled back and accentuated with a shiny hairpin contribute to a sense of verisimilitude even as the nervous quality of her quickly sketched hands, dark tonality, and undefined background give the work an enigmatic aspect. The range of deep blacks and grays and restricted, close-cropped composition suggest the influence of Whistler-whose lithographic works were also displayed in the first Secession exhibition.

<br>
The female figure is consistent with nineteenth-century representations that promoted negative stereotypes of African Americans as lazy, greedy, mischievous, or jovial. With her toothy grin and apron held out to the side, the girl is exemplary of the trope of the “dancing fool” perpetuated by the minstrel show. Such troubling representations of African Americans were common in toys marketed to white, middle class children in the Victorian era—such as this example—which served to perpetuate notions of inferiority and racial difference.

He worked as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, draughtsman, and designer, and is known as one of the instigators of the Fauvist movement. From late 1917 on, he worked in and around Nice, creating works celebrated for their bright colors and decorative patterning. 
<br><br>
Matisse's interest in the expressive qualities of both line and color appears forcefully in this painting of Lydia Delectorskaya -a Russian refugee, the nurse of Matisse's wife, and the artist's muse and model from 1935 to 1939. The reddish brown ground at lower left and center, and the yellow, green, and blue colors along with the white ground under the sitter's face, hair, and neck show the work to be incomplete. However, Matisse signed and dated it in 1936, indicating that, at least by some measure, he considered it finished. 
<br><br>
The work was painted in Matisse's home and studio in Nice on place Charles- Félix, and, in a book of reminiscences by the model, was titled <I>Bodice on a ""Tahiti"" Background</I>. Matisse had traveled in Oceania in 1930-31 and brought back memories of its colors, plants, and flowers. In a number of works made in 1935 and 1936, the artist alludes to the colors he associated with that trip-bright reds, fuchsias, greens, yellows, and blues. A photograph of the work-in-process indicates that Matisse made numerous changes before considering the work complete; the model's head was once further to the right, her face was changed from a long oval to a more rounded form, and her hand was once positioned closer to her shoulder (the <I>pentimento</I> of this is visible in the work). Her piercing expression was added after the photograph was taken.

Such devices could be found on shields, in coats of arms, on noble household items, and more; and they were often collected into poetic miscellanies known as emblem books.  Among the most well known of the customary images was that of Fortuna, or Fate, often depicted as a young woman balancing upon a sphere. It is just such an emblem that Poudreau’s disembodied hand is seen to draw. The clever and self-reflexive figure of the drawing hand suggests that we ourselves create our systems of belief, such as those that inscribe value to “Fate.” The precariousness of the unknown, perhaps, can be counterbalanced by the arts and human ingenuity."

The project did not take shape until years later, in 1914, when the statesman Georges Clemenceau encouraged Monet to undertake it. The small Japanese footbridge that was part of his garden, covered with a metal trellis with wisteria flowers that vertically expanded the floral display, provided the inspiration for a series of works depicting wisteria.  Monet initially envisaged a frieze of such paintings above the large canvases of water lilies, and the present work is one of the surviving paintings from this aspect of the project, which was never fully realized. 
<br><br>
In the Oberlin painting, the tangle of colored lines and the variegated blues of the sky give a tremendous sense of movement to the work. The closely cropped viewpoint, the thick brushstrokes, and the palpable energy of the painting show it to be a forerunner of later twentieth-century abstraction. 
<br><br>
At first, the French government considered installing Monet's works in the Hôtel de Biron (now the Musée Rodin), but eventually the renovated Musée de l'Orangerie in the Tuileries was chosen, where the water-lily paintings were installed in 1927, and whose dimensions were not large enough to accommodate the wisteria paintings. The present work remained in Monet's studio after his death.

After spending some years in Paris, Sisley lived in several villages along the Seine and Loing rivers; he settled permanently in Moret-sur-Loing in 1889. By restricting himself to just a few favored subjects, Sisley was able to focus on the changing effects of light and color that occurred in the surrounding landscape. Critics noted that Sisley’s original coloring, particularly his use of a lilac-tinted blue, set his work apart from his fellow Impressionists. Sisley’s focus on the sky as a significant compositional element led the Symbolist writer Camille Mauclair to call him “the painter of French skies, which he presents with admirable vivacity and facility.” A landscape painter to the near exclusion of all other subjects, Sisley enjoyed a fair amount of commercial success early on in his career, but fell on harder financial times later in his life. Nevertheless, his work enjoyed a strong standing among his artistic peers. When Henri Matisse asked Camille Pissarro to identify an exemplary Impressionist, Pissarro named Sisley.
<br><br>
In this work, Sisley’s freely applied paint activates the surface of the canvas to convey the effect of the brilliant sunlight reflecting off the leaves of the trees and the water in the canal below. Specific details are secondary to the synthesis of color and light in the definition of the forms of the trees, the canal, and the architecture. In contrast to Monet’s tendency to dissolve form in a bath of light and color, Sisley used light and color to enhance the structure of his compositions. He felt that a lively painting surface was the most significant aspect of a work and it “should transmit to the beholder the sensation which possessed the artist” to depict the subject.

This work was originally gilded but probably lost its gold coating in a fire. It may have been enshrined in a monastery or the home of a wealthy family, perhaps part of a trio of buddhas. Identification as the Medicine Master Buddha is speculative but based on a standard representation in which one hand rests on the lap and holds a small jar of medicine. Look at the proper right hand—the tips of the middle fingers are broken, and the breakage pattern suggests that the fingers supported something, perhaps the medicine jar. Furthermore, this buddha often held aloft the seed of the myrobalan fruit (<i>Terminalia chebula</i>), respected as a healing plant. The raised left hand seems to once have grasped something, possibly a lost seed. 

Although this work was created in Northern China when it was ruled by the Liao [LEEOW] Dynasty (916–1125 CE) of the Khitan people, it follows the influential Chinese Buddhist art style of the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE)—the hair is in tight “snail-shell” curls, the face rounded with three rolls of skin on the neck, and the robes hang naturally.

Prior to the French Revolution, Dubois had worked for Louis- Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé (1736-1818), and the fact that Dubois left France for St. Petersburg in 1804 may indicate that he still held some loyalty to the House of Bourbon and was not in sympathy with post-Revolutionary ideals and Napoleon's rule.

This work can be dated to about 1797 by the woman's hairstyle and cravat-a traditionally male article of clothing that women adopted around that time. Female literacy was on the rise in the years during and after the French Revolution, but the ability to read and write was still a mark of the elite at this time. Depictions of women writing are very rare in miniatures-due to space constraints but also perhaps to the difficulty of painting hands-further enhancing the importance of this work.

(191.8 × 50.8 × 48.3 cm),,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund and Mrs. F. F. Prentiss Fund,Italian,,"Lifelike-and nearly life-size-statues such as this arresting Saint Sebastian were prevalent in churches in Renaissance Italy. It is carved in inexpensive wood, which was more easily worked than marble or bronze, and allowed for an easy naturalism. The unknown sculptor was concerned with verisimilitude, carving small white teeth between gently parted lips, and accentuating the saint's realistic ribcage, as well as depicting subtly bluish veins with red blood dripping from wounds-all of which contribute to the statue's striking realism. The arms were separately carved and joined to the torso, and there are numerous joins of the wood on the back and rear thighs. The work was likely once attached to a column or fictive tree trunk, but has been fully finished in the round. Consistent with other known similar wooden statues of the saint, the now-filled holes that once held arrows are only present on the front of the work. The saint's crossed legs impart both a sense of reality, as well as one of nonchalance, in defiance of his would-be assassins. 
<br><br>
Because of his many wounds, Saint Sebastian was seen as an important intercessor for victims of the plague, and was certainly one of the most popular saints of the age. The AMAM possesses two other striking representations of the saint, Hendrick ter Brugghen's <I>Saint Sebastian Tended by Irene</I> of 1625 and Giovanni Boccati's altarpiece fragment showing Saint John the Baptist and Saint Sebastian of around 1460.

Frame: 24 3/8 × 24 3/8 × 4 in. (61.9 × 61.9 × 10.2 cm)",,Gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation,Italian,,"Sofonisba Anguissola is one of only a few known female artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Born into a noble family in Cremona, she was encouraged in her artistic pursuits by her father (who corresponded with Michelangelo to procure a drawing that his daughter could use to copy). She studied with local painters before traveling to Rome where she met with and was instructed by Michelangelo. In 1559, Anguissola traveled to Milan and then Spain at the invitation of King Philip II, joining his court as a painter and lady-in-waiting to the queen; she spent over twenty years in Madrid, primarily painting portraits. She later married and settled in Genoa and Palermo, where she was visited in 1624 by the painter Van Dyck, dying the following year in her nineties. Her work was important enough in her lifetime to be mentioned by Giorgio Vasari, who noted in his <I>Lives of the Artists</I> that Anguissola had ""worked with deeper study and greater grace than any woman of our times."" 
<br><br>
The <I>tondo</I> (or ""round"") format of <I>Double Portrait</I> is believed to derive from several sources, including depictions of heroes on ancient Roman shields or circular images on Greek vases-such as that found in the center of the AMAM's kylix by Epiktetus (no. 8). The <I>tondo</I> was revived in Renaissance Italy and was used for figural works and portraits, as well as smaller designs for portrait medals, medallions, and miniatures. Although the round shape can have sepulchral overtones-many ancient sarcophagi feature <I>tondi</I> portraits-there is nothing to indicate that the boy and girl in <I>Double Portrait</I> were deceased at the time it was created. Far fewer large-scale portrait <I>tondi</I> exist, as opposed to religious and devotional <I>tondi</I>, which makes the AMAM painting relatively rare. 
<br><br>
The Attavanti were a prominent Florentine family, and although the inscription on the painting is only partially legible, enough remains to indicate that the work likely depicts two children from that family. Depicted with sensitivity and a great sense of realism, the young boy looks up from reading a small book, and the girl, likely his sister, affectionately holds him close.

Io, transformed into a cow by Jupiter, stands between the figures, while a goat looks on at right; mythology;",Gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation,Italian,,"This seemingly serene scene by Pier Francesco Mola is an episode from Ovid's <I>Metamorphoses</I> showing the god Mercury, his winged staff behind him, lulling the giant Argus to sleep by playing music on a pipe. In the tale, Argus-here depicted with lidded eyes, leaning heavily on a wooden staff-had been entrusted by Juno with the care of Io, a princess whom the jealous goddess had turned into the cow seen in the painting's center. Jove, in love with Io, sent Mercury disguised as a goatherder to kill the giant, thus setting Io free. 
<br><br>
According to Ovid, Argus had one hundred eyes, but in Mola's interpretation his hideous countenance is moderated in favor of that of a bearded man enjoying a seemingly idyllic woodland moment. The painting is one of a number of small-scale mythological works the artist painted at about the same time. Four other versions of the same subject by the artist are known: paintings in the Denis Mahon collection, London, and the Staatliche Museen, Berlin; a preparatory drawing for the Berlin painting now in the museum in Orléans; and an etching. With the AMAM's Domenichino, Jacopo Ligozzi, and Giovanni Battista Gaulli, it is one of just a handful of seventeenthcentury Italian paintings in the collection. 
<br><br>
The painting, along with one by Sofonisba Anguissola, is among ten works formerly in the Samuel H. Kress collection donated to the AMAM by the Kress Foundation in 1961, and which have greatly enhanced the AMAM's collection of Italian paintings.

The joke was on the writer, however, as Dubuffet went on to become the most significant French artist in the postwar period. 
<br><br>
Dubuffet broke ground in the use of new materials in painting, often working in extremely heavy impasto with a granular medium. Antiauthoritarian and highly intelligent, Dubuffet became a creative force not simply in painting, sculpture, and printmaking, but also through his writings and his championship and collecting of what is known (by his naming of it) as Art Brut.

Along with seventeen other works, the seven Dubuffets were a gift to the AMAM from Joseph and Enid Bissett-both good friends of the artist, as is attested by a lively correspondence in the AMAM files.

Though not an exact copy—Baillie added the arch and the lower half of Anguissola’s body—it captures the light illuminating her face and hands, as well as her canvas. Baillie’s mezzotint is evidence of appreciation for her work in the 18th century, when many Europeans purchased prints based on paintings they admired. The mezzotint technique was suited to imitating the effect of paint because, unlike other methods of the time, it allowed for subtle gradations between light and dark. A printmaker would roughen the entire surface of the metal printing plate to make it hold ink, then burnish the white areas smooth.

Of all the works produced by members of the Impressionist school, Renoir's are perhaps the most immediately engaging, and this was due in no small part to his choice of subjects - often women and children. Equally impressive was his skill in uniting the human figure with the landscape setting as is evident in this work. By the mid-1880s, Renoir's adherence to the Impressionist's aesthetic had begun to waver and he became much more interested in sculptural form. He also started to spend more time on his preparatory studies, as seen here, working up the structural elements in the composition. Over the course of his long career, he painted many portraits of his wife and children, and after 1890, he concentrated almost exclusively on the members of his family and household staff."

This same tree appears in several of Cézanne's paintings and other drawings."

Frame: 30 1/8 × 24 3/8 × 2 7/8 in. (76.5 × 61.9 × 7.3 cm)",Joan Miro;,Gift of Joseph and Enid Bissett,Spanish,,"Joan Miró began studying art in his native Barcelona in 1907. He moved to Paris in 1920, and during that decade his work moved from realism toward abstract, whimsical shapes often reminiscent of natural forms. He worked in this style, which he continued to refine, throughout the rest of his life, dividing his time between France and Spain. 
<br><br>
Miró's dreamlike painting shows the rhythmic figures, birds, suns, stars, and other elements that characterized his creative output in the 1940s and '50s. It is reminiscent of his <I>Constellations</I> series of small gouaches on paper, created during 1940-41, in which he created biomorphic and astronomical forms. 
<br><br>
<I>Women, Bird and Serpent in Front of the Sun</I> is from a group of works the artist made in Spain during the years of the Second World War. In 1948, he spoke of this group, stating,

<blockquote>I produced a great deal at this time, working very quickly. And just as I worked very carefully [in the <I>Constellations</I>] which had immediately preceded these, ""controlling"" everything, now I worked with the least control possible-at any rate in the first phase, the drawing. Even here, however, only the broad outlines were unconsciously done. The rest was carefully calculated. The broad initial 
drawing, generally in grease crayon, served as a point of departure. . . . I drew carefully around the stains [in the canvas's ground] and made them the center of the composition. The slightest thing served me as a jumping off place in this period. .!.!. The first stage is free, unconscious; but after that the picture is controlled throughout, in keeping with that desire for discipline which I have felt from the beginning.</blockquote> 

The irregular shape of this work is original; the canvas was likely cut from a larger primed and stretched support, and small holes, filled and in-painted when they were noted in 1978, may indicate it was tacked to a support. It is one of forty the artist painted on unstretched canvases of irregular shapes. Another Miró in the AMAM collection-<I>The Spokesmen of the Birds Plunges into the Night</I>, made a decade later- is painted on cardboard and contains the biomorphic and animal shapes seen in the artist's earlier works, but in a composition which is more open. 
<br><br>
Both of these paintings, along with two Miró pastels made during the war years, <I>Women Dreaming of Escape</I> (1942) and <I>Woman and Bird in Front of the Sun</I> (1943), and numerous other mid-twentieth century European works, were gifts of Joseph and Enid Bissett. On the advice of their nephew, J. R. Judson, who graduated from Oberlin and went on to become an eminent Dutch and Flemish art historian, they gave much of their important collection of mid- twentieth- century European art to the AMAM, greatly strengthening the museum's holdings in this area.

(32.9 × 50.7 cm),,Gift of Joseph and Enid Bissett,French,,"After moving from Paris to Nice in 1917, Matisse separated himself from the avant-garde and modernist methods of construction that he had been using in grand decorative compositions, and turned to a more naturalistic style with an emphasis on subjects that gave him pleasure. His first years in Nice were dominated by his attention to the nude female form. This drawing probably features Matisse's favorite model between the years 1920 and 1927, Henriette Darricarrère, a musician and ballet dancer. In this work and others from the same period, Matisse explored the mass and balance of seated and reclining female nudes through varying poses."

Prentiss Fund,Chinese,Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644),"In this small landscape, space becomes ambiguous and full of contradictions. The distance of the mountains is emphasized by their indistinct, mist-shrouded forms, as well as the sudden transition from solid foreground hills and trees to soft, blue peaks.

The whole scene is accentuated with gold paper that suggests the glow of dawn or early evening.

Here the artist masterfully draws a stately camel, seen from below, using deep shading on its underbelly and neck, allowing the sheet to serve as highlighting. Underneath the camel's head and neck appears, faintly, a second larger study of a camel's head, very lightly drawn in black chalk. The hedgehog, appropriately, is seen from above, and here too the sheet itself serves to give texture to the animal's thick coat. Although later in life Ligozzi created large paintings, he worked often in miniature, in both oil and gouache, reveling in details of texture, color, and shading.

(188 × 61 cm),multicolor leaded glass shade with floral frieze; bronze base with green patina,Capital Equipment Fund,American,,"Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933) was one of the most influential artists and designers of the twentieth century. He largely bypassed a career with his father's famous jewelry firm, Tiffany & Co., and took up painting, studying with George Inness, later discovering his true love, that of colored glass. He pioneered research into the fabrication of iridescent, translucent, and colored glasses with textured surfaces, which created dramatic light effects. He was further influenced by artist John La Farge (1835-1910), who was also researching glass production in the 1870s; due to their intense competition, however, their friendship did not last. The AMAM has a magnificent watercolor and gouache by La Farge, <I>Ford at the Upper End of the Vai-Te-Piha ( Tautira River), Tahiti</I>, of 1891, which seems itself to shimmer with the translucent colors of stained glass. 
<br><br>
Thomas Edison, who had been experimenting with electricity since the 1860s, encouraged Tiffany to explore the production of electric lamps, and most of them were made between 1895 and 1920. The magnificent floor lamp with floral stained-glass shade in the AMAM collection was a fortunate acquisition-it was purchased at an auction at the American Legion Hall in Elyria, Ohio, from the estate of a local resident, for under $100.00 in 1963. 
<br><br>
Among the more than fifteen Tiffany pieces in the collection is also a delicate vase with a pineapple-shaped base (some describe similar bases as pinecone- or artichoke-shaped). The <I>favrile</I>-Tiffany's word, based on the old English usage for ""handmade""-iridescent glass is decorated in a ""pulled-feather"" design, and its soaring trumpet shape gives it a sense of lightness and delicacy. It was a gift to the AMAM from Oberlin alumnus and Emeritus Professor Paul Arnold (OC 1940) and his wife, Sally (OC 1941). Arnold, a distinguished artist, is represented by both prints and drawings in the AMAM collection. The drawings are five watercolor and gouache works depicting the interior of the Cass Gilbert building, made while he was a student during 1939-40."

Olney Fund,French,,"By publishing his own engravings and catering to a mass market, William Hogarth was the first artist to exploit printmaking as an alternative to traditional patronage.  His satirical social commentaries embraced the common and irreverent, sparing no class from his biting wit.  Marriage A-la-Mode, after a series of paintings from 1743, were the most popular of what Hogarth called his ""modern moral subjects"" - didactic tales that unfold through six or eight engravings following the vanities, vices, and ultimate self-destruction of their protagonists.  Embedded emblematic details and accessories further elucidate the narratives depicted. 

Marriage A-la-Mode chronicles the union of the bankrupt Earl Squanderfield's son and a wealthy merchant's daughter, an arrangement intended to elevate the former's financial situation and the latter's social standing.  The lawyer Silvertongue quickly beguiles the young wife into an affair while her husband frequents prostitutes, from whom he has already contracted syphilis in the first scene.  Overindulging in frivolous pastimes and expensive luxuries, the couple's household and relationship falls into disarray.  Upon finding his wife with Silvertongue the husband is fatally wounded by the lawyer, who later hangs for murder.  Distraught, the wife commits suicide, leaving her crippled child motherless.

Situated in the middle ground, Christ goes virtually unnoticed amidst chaotic throngs of masked revelers, arguably functioning as a self-portrait of the artist who felt ignored by society and persecuted by his contemporaries. The festive atmosphere is diminished by the mob-like representation of the populace and the presence of Death wearing a top hat in the foreground. Ensor’s nightmarish depiction of an historical event that never occurred explores the intersection of imagination and anxiety over one’s place in society."

He would return to painting only twenty years later following the Second World War, when he was back in Paris. These mature paintings – comprising portraits, nudes, and still-lifes – follow the stark linearity and geometry of his drawings, distinguished only by the presence of soft areas of impasto and washes, mimicking the smudges and shadows of a drawing. The paintings are often dominated by monochromatic schemes, although strokes of bright colors were introduced in some of the later portraits."

In 1917, at the age of twenty-nine, Pippin enlisted in the army, served in a black regiment, and was wounded in his right hand by a German sniper; he received the French <I>Croix de Guerre</I> and a Purple Heart retroactively in 1945. Once back in civilian life, he began making art, working primarily in the ground floor of his West Chester home at night, under a single lightbulb. Because of his war injury, Pippin painted by holding his right wrist with his left hand to control his brush. 
<br><br>
The artist painted a major series on the life of the abolitionist John Brown, based, in part, on his mother's account of having witnessed Brown's trial and subsequent hanging. Pippin also painted works relating to his military service, and everyday subjects depicting the daily lives of the residents of West Chester, such as is seen in the present work. The flat, vividly colored painting of a quartet of men singing on a street corner-one of which is said to be Pippin's stepson-is a carefully composed work, with multiple vertical and horizontal elements that set off the men in its center. It is both unconventional and natural, coming directly from the artist's personal, small-town experience; he once said, ""Pictures just come to my mind, and then I tell my heart to go ahead."" 
<br><br>
""Discovered"" by the art establishment in the 1930s, Pippin was championed by art collector Dr. Albert C. Barnes, among others. This work was purchased the year it was painted by Enid Bissett, one of the inventors of the Maidenform bra, who with her husband left twenty-four important paintings and drawings to the AMAM collection, including Picasso's <I>Chair and Owl</I> and Modigliani's <I>Nude with Coral Necklace</I>.

(21.7 × 30.6 cm),Image of trees and vegetation with three figures in the foreground and middle ground.,Charles F. Olney Fund,Dutch,,"This drawing has long puzzled experts. One unusual feature is the variety of media employed by the artist: the use of chalk or graphite to first lay out the composition, and the later application of pen and brown ink, indicate that the artist may have copied a preexisting image. Another unusual element is the two figures in the left-hand foreground. Rather than an integral part of the composition, they appear to have been added on top of the already-executed landscape.<br>
<br>
Who are these figures and why were they added to the scene? The one on the left holds a palette, suggesting that they are artists who have gone out into the countryside to document this bucolic vista, in which a lone figure labors in the distance.<br>
<br>
The practice of painting outdoors (<i>en plein air</i>) was more common in the late 1800s among Impressionist artists than it was in the 1600s. The inclusion of these figures—either by the original artist or by a later one—hints at a discomfort with an independent landscape lacking any human narrative. It also reveals a desire to center the role of humans as actors in—and interpreters of—the natural world."

Below her is the vehicle of Brahmā and Brahmi, the haṃsa, often translated as swan or goose.<br>

Brahmi is one of a group of warrior goddesses known as the Seven Mothers (<i>saptamātṝkāh</i>), and this sculpture was probably part of a larger relief sculpture that represented all of the goddesses."

Her son, Prince Wilhelm of Baden, shown here with her, was born in 1829.  In the finished painting, Wilhelm is playing with a long strand of pearls that hangs around his mother's neck, while she loosely holds a sprig of greenery in her left hand.  The drawing may also have served as a presentation piece or exercise in draughtsmanship, as Winterhalter had been appointed drawing-master to the young Grand Duchess in 1829."

Enticing them with a feast, Circe drugged them with her magic and transformed them into swine. Castiglione, an inveterate painter of animals in biblical and historical narratives, diverges from Homer’s text by showing the men as having been turned into a variety of creatures; their armor and clothing, now useless, are scattered in the foreground. Circe, dressed in exotic robes and a turban, appears at left, surrounded by her manuals of magic that bear esoteric markings. Despite Circe’s wicked deed, Castiglione depicts a rather pleasant scene in which the naturalistic rendering of the animals and the intricacy of the etched details of the ruins evoke notions of an idyllic Arcadian past rather than a sinister sense of wrongdoing.

In <I>Charcoal Self-Portrait in a Cement Garden</I>, Dine deftly places charcoal and oil to canvas, adding three-dimensional cement objects that enter into the viewer's space. The imposing over-life-size scale of this piece and its emphasis on structure show the artist distilling form into a powerfully evocative self-portrait.

An advertisement in the <I>New York Times</I> originally inspired Dine's use of the bathrobe motif. The artist said he ""was going to use the image arbitrarily but suddenly it looked as though it had me in it."" Dine began work on his robes in 1964, and the repetition of this theme throughout his career has closely identified it with his personal iconography.

In 1965, a year after <I>Charcoal Self- Portrait in a Cement Garden</I> was made, professor Ellen Johnson invited the young Ohio-born artist to participate in Oberlin's artist-in-residence program. During Dine's residency, a selection of his work was exhibited at the AMAM, marking Dine's first solo museum show. At her death, Johnson bequeathed five works by Dine to the collection. Over the next four decades, the museum continued to acquire his work through purchase and gift. In 2005, an exhibition was held celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the artist's first visit to Oberlin, and Dine presented the museum with a promised gift of four major works on paper.

Frame: 73 1/2 × 61 1/8 × 3 3/8 in. (186.7 × 155.3 × 8.6 cm)",,Mrs. F. F. Prentiss Fund,Italian,,"The painter Gaulli was born in Genoa, but left for Rome at a young age and worked there for the rest of his life, where he was influenced by the sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini and the painter Pietro da Cortona. He is one of the major artists of the Roman Baroque, and worked in predominantly warm, bright colors. His fresco of the <I>Triumph of the Name of Jesus</I> (1678-79), for the ceiling of the Jesuit church of Il Gesù, is a magisterial work of movement, light, and tumbling figures. 
<br><br>
The AMAM painting is a tour-de-force of composition, draftsmanship, and coloration. Adonis, warned by his lover Venus of the dangers of the hunt, has just been gored by the boar, seen over his shoulder. Bright red blood drips onto the ground from his wound, where an anemone springs up in the same hue; his arrows are unused over his shoulder, and his spear lies at his feet. The central putto points toward Adonis with anguished tears, while the one hovering above wipes his eye. In the background, other putti draw their bows to shoot the boar as dogs hold him at bay. Most dramatically, Venus has just arrived, in the very act of jumping from her chariot to the ground (her accompanying doves are all aflutter), in a marvelously twisting pose inspired by the sculptures of Gianlorenzo Bernini. With concern she hovers over her lover, arm outstretched, realizing already from his pallor-the blood has drained completely from his face and gray lips- that all hope is lost. 
<br><br>
Apart from its importance as a major late seventeenth-century Italian work, the painting was also one of the primary impetuses for an exhibition entirely dedicated to Gaulli organized by former AMAM director John Spencer at the museum in 1966-not only the first exhibition ever devoted to the artist, but, with the exception of Caravaggio, the first international loan exhibition outside Italy ever devoted to a seventeenth-century Italian artist.
<br><br>
Richard Spear has convincingly argued that <I>Venus Dissuading Adonis from the Chase</I> (now at Burghley House in England) is the pendant to this work.

This oil study of a rushing spring shows the harsh and varied topography of rock, brush, and water as a set of textures, densities, and incidents of relief.  Its close vantage point, indifferent to the motif as a visual ensemble, was likely intended principally for the artist's own use. The growing popularity of depictions of the natural landscape and the taste for intimate, informal sketches, painted <i>en plein air</i> (out-of-doors), made these works increasingly viable for exhibition and for sale."

Mauve particularly excelled in rendering the profound silence and desolation of winter and often painted directly from nature – en plein air or outdoors – to capture the nuances of his favorite season. It seems likely that the Oberlin picture was painted on the spot, considering its modest size, swift brushwork, and the fact that the painted design extends beyond the edges of the original canvas stretcher. The modest winter scene set with an almost monochromatic palette is suffused with a silvery light, adding a delicate, lyrical quality to the picture.

This subtle and masterful rendering of light garnered praise from Boudin’s contemporaries; Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot once called him “the king of the skies.”<br>
<br>
Only the blue horizon line at the very bottom of the composition suggests that this is a seascape. The son of a mariner, Boudin was intimately familiar with the ever-changing atmosphere of the sea. An important influence on later Impressionists such as Claude Monet, Boudin was one of the first French landscape painters to work outdoors, producing sketches such as this one that he would later incorporate into larger paintings in his studio."

<BR>
<I>White Net Painting</I> was among her first forays into what later became known as Infinity Nets, meticulously rendered accumulations of obsessively repeated strokes that recreate visual hallucinations that the artist has experienced since childhood. Of these works, Kusama has said “I saw the same pattern covering the ceiling, the windows and the walls, and finally all over the room, my body and the universe.

In the 1940s, Epstein began to distance himself from the Vorticist movement that favored a geometric style tending toward abstraction. Moving away from his earlier semi-abstract, almost cubist works, he embraced a more figurative and realist approach in his sculptures. This shift is best seen in his portrait busts of friends and patrons, including this bust of Freud. Although American-born, Epstein was a British citizen and worked in England until his death. This sculpture was one of the works by Epstein acquired through a series of gifts made to American institutions by the sculptor's widow, Lady Kathleen Epstein.

The grand scale of <I>Abstract Painting</I>, if not the uniform surface, brings to mind the vast nineteenth-century landscapes of Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt. 
<br><br>
Reinhardt's ""all-over"" abstract geometric patterns were influenced by the work of Kasimir Malevich and the color blocks and grid structures of Piet Mondrian's paintings. In 1947, the year before the AMAM painting was created, Reinhardt's work was included in <I>The Ideographic Picture</I>, an exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York, which also featured Barnett Newman and Hans Hofmann, further artistic influences for Reinhardt. In his later years, the artist's monochromatic work of the 1950s and 1960s had its own important impact on a younger generation of Minimalist and Conceptual painters and sculptors, including Donald Judd, Jackie Winsor, Carl Andre, Brice Marden, and Frank Stella, who owned a number of Reinhardt's ""black paintings."" 
<br><br>
The first major retrospective of Reinhardt's work was held in 1966 at the Jewish Museum in New York. In March 1967, Reinhardt wrote to Oberlin College's Ellen Johnson that he had been in the hospital and wondered if she had ever received a copy of his Jewish Museum catalogue. He also wanted to know if she was still interested in ""that 76 in. × 144 in. multicolored- rectilinear-formed 1948 painting of mine?"" He added that prices of his paintings were rising but that he would sell it to Oberlin for the price they discussed earlier because he did not want ""any banks to get it. New York banks are clamoring for large paintings, for lobbies."" On June 1, 1967, Reinhardt sent an invoice in his distinctive calligraphic hand confirming the purchase of <I>Abstract Painting</I> for the AMAM collection. Three months later, he died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-three. 
<br><br>
The artist's grandson made an important gift to the AMAM in 2007 of <I>Number 18</I> (1949), a poetic watercolor with freely brushed luminous green squares, gone over with cross-hatching and enlivened by flickering lines of black ink swirling across the watercolor's surface. Together, the grand <I>Abstract Painting</I> and this watercolor give an idea of the range of Reinhardt's vision as he sought to explore the underlying geometric structure and colorism in his work.

He is especially well-known today for his developments in modeling and shading, but his skill did not go unnoticed by his contemporaries. As a young artist, Dürer had traveled to Schongauer's workshop with the intention of working with the artist, but Schongauer had died by the time he arrived.  Even after his death, Schongauer's prints remained greatly influential, often inspiring the works of subsequent printmakers.

Sheet: 9 15/16 × 7 9/16 in. (25.2 × 19.2 cm)",,Gift of the Max Kade Foundation,German,,"Active as a painter, draftsman, and printmaker, Albrecht Dürer was an entrepreneur and a man of great intellectual curiosity, who studied physiognomy, fortifications, engineering theories, and mathematical problems. He wrote and illustrated treatises on perspective and anatomy, explored ideal proportions, and struggled to describe the actions of the human body; all this information he integrated into his art. Dürer's intense observation of the human and natural world is as evident in his simple depictions of animals and plants as in his most complex allegorical compositions. His work as a printmaker-he executed more than 250 engravings, woodcuts, drypoints, and etchings-was enormously influential and spread his name and reputation throughout Europe. 
<br><br>
Dürer's masterful engraving, <I>The Fall of Man</I>, was made in 1504, the year before he made his second trip to Italy. While the frontal and somewhat static figures of Adam and Eve were undoubtedly influenced by classical sculpture, Dürer's composition is his own invention. His deep preoccupation with understanding how the image was evolving and how to establish a dark background from which lighter figures would emerge was developed by printing trial impressions. A number of proofs of this engraving are extant, including one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They demonstrate how the artist worked on the background first and saved the figures for last. Preparatory drawings, including one of Adam and Eve, in the Morgan Library & Museum, show the care with which Dürer developed every detail of human and animal form. The collection includes another impression of this work, given to the AMAM in 2006 by Ken and Linda Preston.

The AMAM's rich holdings of ninety-four Dürer prints are nearly all gifts of the Max Kade Foundation and provide Oberlin students with a superlative resource for study, teaching, and research.

The monkey that figures in the title of this print, here shown tethered to the gate to the left of Mary and Jesus, has commonly been interpreted as a sign of evil. Paired with the Virgin Mary, the animal references the figure of Eve, whose original sin contrasts with the Virgin Mary's purity."

Such scenes were especially common in northern Italian art, and Dürer imported the motif to Germany following his first visit to Italy in 1494-5. In this scene, Saint Jerome kneels before a crucifix, wielding in his right hand the stone with which he would habitually beat his chest. At the saint’s heels is the lion that, according to legend, followed Jerome after the saint had removed a thorn from his paw. While working in a largely Italian subject matter, Dürer alludes to his native Germany in the landscape background, taken from his studies of rock quarries near Nuremberg."

His later landscape prints are open-ended images in which skies are predominately white, terrain is flat, and very little happens to interrupt the picturesque calm of the scene. Neatly contained by a gently arched frame at the top, <I>Landscape with Three Gabled Cottages</I> is both a careful portrait of rural cottages and an intimate expression of a local scene. Similarities to the motifs of the foreground tree, the cottages, and the road-which is wide and dark in front and narrows as it winds toward the horizon- appear in two Rembrandt drawings (AMAMA 1967.44 and 1952.31) that depict a property on the Sloterweg River near Amsterdam and which may have served as inspiration for this etching. 
<br><br>
This print is known in three states. The dramatic light and dark areas of the first state, described with rich areas of drypoint, are transformed in the second and third states with shading and cross- hatching alterations and additions. The AMAM's beautiful impression of the third state clearly demonstrates the overall tonal harmony Rembrandt sought to achieve throughout the landscape, with a careful balance of etched details and velvety drypoint lines visible throughout the foliage. 
<br><br>
The AMAM's <I>Three Gabled Cottages</I> was formerly in the collection of John Webster (1810-1891), a Scottish collector known for his distinguished group of Rembrandt landscape etchings. It passed to the New York banker Albert W. Scholle (d. 1910) and was eventually acquired by the German-born entrepreneur and pharmaceutical researcher Max Kade (1882-1967), who immigrated to New York in 1905. At his death in 1967, the Max Kade Foundation gave the AMAM an outstanding collection of woodcuts, engravings, and etchings by Dürer , Heinrich Aldegrever, Martin Schongauer, and others. The gift transformed the museum's print holdings, enabling faculty and museum staff to teach both survey courses and in-depth seminars.

Prentiss Fund,Dutch,,"The AMAM is especially fortunate to have in its collection a number of works by artists made early in their careers. One outstanding example is Piet Mondrian's <I>Brabant Farmyard</I>, created during the time when the artist was influenced by the naturalism of the nineteenth-century Dutch painters of the Hague School. Mondrian spent the year of 1904 in the village of Uden, Brabant (southern Holland), where this work was likely painted. 
<br><br>
Farmhouses in the Brabant were distinctive for their sloping thatched roofs and barn doors on their lateral sides. Here, the artist depicts three cows and a farmwoman in front of the doors to the stable and barn; the chimney toward the right divides the stable from family living quarters. The roof of the barn appears to be finished in its lower third with tiles, as indicated by the small planes of colors and short strokes seen there. 
<br><br>
Although quite different from Mondrian's later, iconic abstract works made up of rectangular fields formed by black, white, red, yellow, and blue, this painting nevertheless conveys a sense of balance, order, and harmony in its largely frontal depiction of the barn, and its flat planes of muted color. In 1942, Mondrian wrote about such works:

<blockquote>I preferred to paint landscape and houses seen in grey, dark weather or in very strong sunlight, when the density of atmosphere obscures the details and accentuates the large outlines of objects. I often sketched by moonlight- cows resting or standing immovable on flat Dutch meadows, or houses with dead, blank windows. I never painted these things romantically; but from the very
beginning, I was always a realist.</blockquote>

The AMAM's collection includes a small group of works created by Hague School artists, including <I>Mother and Son</I>, <I>Twilight</I> by Jozef Israëls, <I>The Bridge</I> by Jacob Maris, an untitled landscape by Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, and <I>Snow Storm</I> by Anton Mauve.

Sheet: 4 × 5 9/16 in. (10.2 × 14.1 cm)",,Mrs. F. F. Prentiss Fund,German,,"According to medieval sources, Veronica wiped Christ’s face with her veil as he was carrying his cross to Calvary. Miraculously, the image of his face appeared on her veil. The “Holy Face” became an exceptionally popular Catholic icon in both paintings and prints, functioning as an object of devotion and contempla-tion for the faithful. 
<br><br>
Dürer’s depictions of the <i>sudarium</i> (literally “sweat cloth”) present divergent characterizations of the revered object. Rather than show the narrative of Veronica and Christ, Dürer focused instead on the cloth with the miraculous image, held aloft by angels. In the earlier print, the angels and sudarium appear frontally in a traditional and symmetrical composition that accentuates the cloth’s status as a sacred object of worship. The later version  (1981.33) conveys the miraculous quality of the <i>sudarium</i> by depicting the angel dramatically unfurling it above a group of angels holding the instruments of Christ’s Passion. The crisply engraved lines of the more static composition in the 1513 print  (1967.50) contrast with the gestural etched lines of the 1516 version that emphasize the angel’s dynamic movement.

This image is characteristic of the artist’s style from the 60s, when she created large metal and canvas hangings with dynamic, abstract organic forms and voids. Many of the women who participated in the feminist art movement of the 70s have considered Bontecou’s signature deep circular opening motif as a celebration of the female body due to its striking allusion to female genitalia. In interviews, however, Bontecou has publicly denied that her art is a commentary on feminist issues or women’s bodies, declaring, “Art is art and it doesn’t mean [sic] whether it’s woman or man.”"

In substituting the word “mouth” for eyes, Johns implies that while journalists might have much to say about his work, they are not truly seeing his art at all.

In 1966, Morris had created a rectangular plaster model showing the circular earth mound he proposed to Smithson, invoking a form he had employed in his earlier Minimalist work.

Two years later, while examining small pottery fragments from a recent donation to the Getty Museum in Malibu, von Bothmer came across a small piece that he immediately recognized as part of one of the missing sections of Oberlin's cup. The Getty generously donated the fragment to the AMAM in 1988, though it has not been integrated into the cup.

His first one-man show of works in plaster and drawings was held in Paris in 1909 at Galerie Druet, and the works shown there-many of them inspired by classical Greece-clearly influenced other artists at the time, including Brancusi, Modigliani, and Picasso. Nadelman then moved to New York City, where he worked for the remainder of his career. 
<br><br>
One of the artist's early supporters was Helena Rubinstein (1870-1965), the Polish cosmetics mogul, who had purchased the entire contents of the exhibition of his works held in London in April 1911 at the William B. Paterson Gallery, which included ten marble heads. The AMAM sculpture of a classical head, of exquisite modeling, is one of the most accomplished of Nadelman's early works in marble, and almost certainly was in that exhibition. The sculpture was in Helena Rubinstein's collection until her death. 
<br><br>
Nadelman is known for stylized, formally clear faces and busts, almost all of which display a poise and balance inspired by antiquity. Athena Tacha Spear, former AMAM curator of modern art, Oberlin professor, and a sculptor herself, noted in her scholarship on the artist that ""he used antiquity as a pretext, he borrowed its vocabulary, to create a language which fitted his own message."" Nadelman himself, in 1910 (just about the time he created the AMAM sculpture) said of his art: ""I employ no other line than the curve, which possesses freshness and force. I compose these curves so as to bring them in accord or in opposition to one another. In that way I obtain the life of form, i.e., harmony.!.!.!."" This is readily apparent in the AMAM bust, whose elegant and harmonious lines create an androgynous, serene face which is indebted to classical works but is strikingly modern.

In his own work, Judd began to use exclusively geometric forms made of Plexiglas, wood, and metal, arranged serially on the wall or on the floor. He called vertical works “stacks,” and horizontal works like this one “progressions.” The number of units was arbitrary, but gave the impression that they could continue on, <i>ad infinitum</i>. The one-after-another quality of Judd’s objects mirrored the reality of industrial production and played up the fact that, after a few early attempts at fabricating the objects himself, he had handed over creation of the works to a professional studio, where the boxes could be executed with absolute precision."

Miraculously, the man is healed. Here Rembrandt has focused on the moment when Peter’s compassion is transformed into a miracle of faith. As is typical of Rembrandt’s depiction of biblical subjects, the dramatic aspect of the miracle is downplayed in favor of the human component of the narrative."

Here he uses a large range of tonalities of gray, black, and white, in lines, smudges, and drips both opaque and transparent to form a target, a motif he depicted beginning in 1955 in more than fifty paintings, drawings, and prints. 
<br><br>
The AMAM drawing is, in part, a replica of a larger black-and-white painting of 1959, which was subsequently destroyed by fire in 1961. It dates from the same year Johns began making prints, and in it, he manipulates the graphite wash almost as if it were the liquid used in lithography, gaining a large variety of textures and tones. The artist stated that he preferred to paint flat symbols, such as flags and targets, because he did not need to design them-they were ""things the mind already knows. That gave me room to work on other levels."" 
<br><br>
Along with Robert Rauschenberg, Johns is one of the most prominent American artists of the mid-twentieth century and helped to usher in the transition from abstract art to representational art in the 1950s and '60s. The two artists, close friends, lived in the same New York building early in their careers and influenced each other's work.

Roush Contemporary Art Fund and National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities Grant,American,,"A versatile and inventive painter and printmaker, Frank Stella graduated from Princeton University in 1958 and moved to New York. A year later, Stella's work was included in a group exhibition held at the AMAM, <I>Three Young Americans</I>. The four paintings Stella exhibited were characteristic of his early work: stripes drawn in pencil and painted with black, or occasionally, two colors.
<br><br>
In 1960, Stella had his first solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery. In that year, he also began his career-long exploration of selected themes, for each of which he made a series of related, but varied, paintings; many were made on irregularly shaped canvases. The AMAM painting belongs to the <I>Protracto</I>r series, on which Stella worked from 1967 to 1969 (with additions until 1971). These were monumental pictures, celebrating bright color, form, and pattern-the average width being nearly twenty feet; <I>Agbatana III</I> measures ten feet high and fifteen feet wide. 
<br><br>
Stella planned the <I>Protractor</I> series to comprise ninety-three paintings: thirty-one different shapes, each with three different designs-described by the artist as ""interlaces,"" ""rainbows,"" and ""fans""-and designated by Roman numerals. The titles in the series refer to ancient circular cities in Asia Minor, reflecting Stella's interest in Islamic art and the Near East, where he traveled in 1963. <I>Agbatana III</I> is the third (or ""fan"") variation in the group named for that ancient city, known today as Hamadan, located in west central Iran. In the fifth century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus described the city as surrounded by seven concentric walls of different colors: 

<blockquote>The circuit of the outer wall is very nearly the same with that of Athens. On this wall, the battlements are white, of the next black, of the third scarlet, of the fourth blue, the fifth orange; all these colors with paint. The last two have their battlements coated respectively with silver and gold.</blockquote> 

<I>Agbatana III</I>'s fan- and wedged-shaped patterns are set on a broad horizontal base and a vertical side that meet at a right angle. The patterns are unified by the brilliant red band that surrounds the picture. In fall 1967, Stella showed several of his first Protractor paintings at the Leo Castelli Gallery. The following year, the AMAM was among the earliest buyers of this ambitious and important body of work, now seen as iconical 1960s painting.

F. Prentiss Fund,Italian,,"The majesty and monumentality of the figures, gestures, and expressions in this small copper painting by Domenichino belie its diminutive size. As Joseph, Mary, and Jesus leave for Egypt, escaping Herod's decree, a boatman struggles mightily with his pole to hold steady the boat that will carry them. Joseph tenderly looks toward Mary and offers her his arm as she steps aboard, while the Christ child sleeps deeply and the donkey which brought them to the river's edge begins to graze. 
<br><br>
The landscape is reminiscent of Rome, where Domenichino painted the work early in his career. He was heavily influenced by Annibale Carracci, with whom he worked on a similar landscape scene of the same subject, as part of a group of works known as the Aldobrandini lunettes that helped to define and establish the entire seventeenth-century classical landscape tradition. Here, two pyramids and a round building reminiscent of the Pantheon combine known Roman architectural types with the feel of the countryside surrounding that city, and allude to Egypt's most recognized architectural form. The low houses to the left and lightly brushed indications of two figures on the path in the distance help to alleviate the solitude of the scene. Domenichino's careful rendering of the foliage and clear colors add to the work's delicacy.

In the hands of Goya, one of the most significant figures in the history in Spanish art, however, the result is something entirely different. Equal parts satire, caricature, and social commentary, the plates of <i>Los Caprichos</i> were intended as condemnation of human folly, superstitions, and cruelty. Although many of the images and their captions continue to resist coherent interpretation, their biting wit and exceptionally humbling effect have a universal appeal that continues to amuse and moralize even today. Publication of this series firmly established Goya as one of the most incisive and original artistic minds of his time.

Located in the section of <i>Los Caprichos</i> that deals with prostitution, this image comments on the proliferation of venereal disease in its depiction of young ladies of the night and an old procuress capturing, plucking, and disemboweling male avian customers attracted to the alluring she-bird in the tree above."

In this depiction of the first miracle performed by the Apostles after Christ's crucifixion, St. Peter stretches his left arm out towards the man, situated on the floor below him, as St. John stands to Peter's left in the background.

An image of Jesus' face miraculously remained imprinted on the cloth, or sudarium, which is shown held in the hands of an angel in the upper left. Representations of the sudarium became increasingly popular towards the latter part of the Middle Ages, when they were often thought to protect viewers from death.  The four angels in the background of the scene each hold Instruments of the Passion, objects associated with Christ's suffering and death.  In this image, Dürer experimented with the technique of iron etching, first used for making prints in the early sixteenth century.  Dürer only executed five prints in this medium, all completed between the years 1515-18.

(24.8 × 18.7 cm),,Gift of the Max Kade Foundation,German,,"Active as a painter, draftsman, and printmaker, Albrecht Dürer was an entrepreneur and a man of great intellectual curiosity, who studied physiognomy, fortifications, engineering theories, and mathematical problems. He wrote and illustrated treatises on perspective and anatomy, explored ideal proportions, and struggled to describe the actions of the human body; all this information he integrated into his art. Dürer's intense observation of the human and natural world is as evident in his simple depictions of animals and plants as in his most complex allegorical compositions. His work as a printmaker-he executed more than 250 engravings, woodcuts, drypoints, and etchings-was enormously influential and spread his name and reputation throughout Europe. 
<br><br>
This beautiful impression of <I>The Prodigal</I> Son shows in brilliant detail Dürer's poignantly human interpretation of the biblical parable as a contemporary genre scene-an effect heightened by the artist's naturalistic rendering of the thatched architecture of a German farmyard. The ragged and barefoot peasant, swineherd, and landscape underscore Dürer's keen observation and specificity of description. Here, Dürer combines the critical moment of penitence and return, an iconography adopted by later artists, including Rembrandt.

Since the Middle Ages, this description has been associated with the Virgin Mary, giving rise to images such as the one shown here, which became increasingly popular in the 15th and early 16th centuries.
<br><br>
Christian iconography traditionally depicted the Virgin Mary astride a pristine, translucent moon to emphasize her immaculate nature, as in this sixteenth-century print by Albrecht Dürer. However, in 1610 Galileo published lunar engravings based on telescopic observations, which revealed for the first time a cratered moon surface. Intellectuals and artists associated with the Church resisted Galileo's findings, believing them an affront to both the idea of the heavens' perfection and Mary's purity.

Botanicals played a role in Inquisitorial and popular images of witchcraft. In particular, nightshade was thought to bring about hallucinations and feelings of flight. The ingestion of this plant provided the power to draw back a veil and experience a new level of clarity. Before Spanish colonization in the Americas, those who ingested powerful plants were thought to have access to higher knowledge and divine connection.

It is clear that Dürer did not base his depiction on observation since he situated the pig—which seems oddly full-grown for a newborn animal—against a landscape that looks quite similar to one that appeared in the broadsheet, albeit in reverse.

Erasmus had urged Dürer to complete this portrait after meeting the artist in the Netherlands in 1520-21, but was ultimately disappointed with the result, which he considered an inadequate likeness. Dürer may have felt similarly, as the inscription at the top right of the print reads, ""Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam, drawn from the living model by Albrecht Dürer. His writings portray him better."" Whether or not Dürer's portrait adequately describes Erasmus' physical appearance, it certainly emphasizes his intellectual pursuits, via the Greek and Latin inscription, the books surrounding the figure, and the writing implements in Erasmus' hand. Shown in the act of writing a letter, Erasmus in this portrait has been likened by some art historians to representations of the famed letter-writer Saint Jerome, who Renaissance humanists (including Erasmus) revered as a paragon of erudition."

The tradition of showing Christ with his family developed during the late Medieval and Renaissance periods into an opportunity to depict the holy figures more naturalistically and affectionately engaged with each other. Artists of the 16th and 17th centuries focused on the maternal connection between Christ and Mary, and Joseph’s presence as a caring, protective figure became standard. Members of Christ’s extended family, such as the Virgin’s parents, Joachim and Anne, or the young St. John the Baptist, often are included, providing a maternal heritage for the child. Prints of the Holy Family, like the ones displayed here, were circulated throughout Europe and incorporated into lay people’s domestic devotional practices, acting as a reminder of the importance of the family unit.

As recounted in Genesis 16, when Sarai is unable to conceive, she suggests that Abram have a child with Hagar instead.  Here, Pencz depicts the encounter between Abram and Hagar that ensued.

Instead, he sought to create photographs that were detached or unmediated: ""nonsubjective,"" he called them. Born in St. Louis to a well-to-do family, Evans moved to New York City in 1923, settling in Greenwich Village. There he met writers Lincoln Kirstein and James Agee, and artist and photographer Ben Shahn; with each of them he collaborated on a variety of projects. Evans traveled to Cuba in 1933 to illustrate American journalist Carleton Beals's book <I>The Crime of Cuba</I>. In 1936, an assignment for <I>Fortune</I> magazine with Agee culminated in <I>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</I> (1941), a landmark publication that chronicled in text and photographs the lives of Southern sharecroppers. 
<br><br>
During the Depression, Evans photographed poor, rural people in what he believed were unsentimental, direct, and objective ways. From 1935 to 1938, he worked for the Farm Security Administration's (FSA) Historical Section under the directorship of Roy Stryker, who also hired other photographers including Shahn, Arthur Rothstein, Gordon Parks, and Dorothea Lange. <I>Sidewalk in Vicksburg, Mississippi</I>, made for the FSA, shows how deeply immersed Evans was in photographing the American scene, recording commonplace subjects impersonally. Here, an automobile with only its front half visible is parked in front of a wooden building with men idling outside in midday sunshine. Evans often made a number of photographs of the same scene; half a dozen other exposures (in the FSA Collection, Library of Congress) capture different moments: a close-up of some of the men, general views of the street, and various storefronts.

Departing from most depictions of the subject, he represents the moment after Judas has already left the scene. Due to the emphasis placed on the bread and decanter of wine at the bottom right, and the chalice on the table, some scholars have interpreted this as an indication of Dürer's sympathies for the Reformation. In contrast to Catholic practice, reformers encouraged giving both wine and bread to congregants during services, as opposed to just bread. At Easter services in 1523, the year of this print, some churches in Nuremburg distributed both elements to the laity."

While the artist made numerous versions of this subject and composition, the Oberlin painting is regarded as the finest. The nocturnal setting, complex composition, and studied attention to figures and poses in this painting make this one of his most moving works. As a young artist, Caravaggio studied in Cesari's Roman workshop, and although the size of this painting and scale of its figures are vastly removed from those of works by Caravaggio, the moody treatment of light and shadows here demonstrate parallels between the artists' conceptions of chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow to create three-dimensional form.

It was while he was serving as a hospital technician in San Diego during World War II that Rauschenberg became interested in art. After the war, he enrolled in the Kansas City Art Institute and traveled to Paris to study art in 1948. Later that year, Rauschenberg returned to the States to study under artist Josef Albers at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. It was there he met his lifelong friends and collaborators composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham. He also studied at the Art Students League in New York, moving to that city permanently in 1949. 
<br><br>
Rauschenberg's early projects critiqued art making in the context of new ideas of the 1950s. With his friend Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg served as a key link in the transition from Abstract Expressionism to Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptualism. Throughout his life, he created work that was unfailingly experimental, exploring art as a means of communication and an interchange of ideas. 
<br><br>
In the AMAM's <I>Combine Drawing</I>, Rauschenberg used traditional media- charcoal, crayon, and watercolor-to create an original work of art. But he also appropriated images from mass media- photographs of Sophia Loren, John F. Kennedy, and others-collaging them onto the white sheet of paper, then drawing and painting over them to create ""combine,"" or hybrid drawing, that mixes media, genres, and objects. 
<br><br>
Rauschenberg questioned the ideas of ""the original"" and ""the masterpiece"" throughout his oeuvre. In the <I>Automobile Tire Print</I> (1951) that he made with Cage, Rauschenberg laid out strips of white paper while Cage drove over them with his Model A Ford, creating prints from the tires Rauschenberg had inked. In 1953, in another notorious gesture, Rauschenberg boldly asked Willem de Kooning for one of his drawings so that he could erase it. De Kooning generously agreed, and Rauschenberg's <I>Erased de Kooning Drawing</I> (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) stands as an icon of his respect for Abstract Expressionism and his notion that process is central to art making. 
<br><br>
<I>Combine Drawing</I> makes a fascinating comparison with Johns's<I>Target </I>, another drawing from 1960. Like Rauschenberg, Johns represented a familiar object, a barroom dartboard, in a new context. In <I>Combine Drawing</I>, boundaries between the original object and the artwork are further blurred by incorporating actual images cut from newspapers or magazines. By encouraging the viewer's active participation, the AMAM drawing recalls Rauschenberg's oft-quoted statement, ""Painting relates to both art and life .!.!. I try to act in the gap between the two.""

According to him, such works symbolized the very acts of creation and revelation. Newman remembered his first such painting, entitled <I>Onement</I> and later modified to <I>Onement I</I>, as a profound moment of change in his career:

<BLOCKQUOTE>I recall my first painting-that is, where I felt I had moved into an area for myself that was completely me- and I painted it on my birthday in 1948. It's a small red painting, and I put a piece of tape in the middle, and I put my so-called zip.<BLOCKQUOTE>

In previous works, Newman had made both paintings and drawings that consisted of a narrow zip in a field of color; <I>Onement</I>, however, was the first in which these parts appeared congruently in one field, rather than as a ziplike ""figure"" and a receding ""ground."" This would characterize the rest of his artistic practice.

In August of 1949, Newman visited Native American burial grounds in southern Ohio and was moved by the sublime sense of his small, human presence amid the vast landscape, writing,

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here is the self-evident nature of the artistic act, its utter simplicity. There are no subjects-nothing that can be shown in a museum or even photographed; [it is] a work of art that cannot even be seen, so it is something that must be experienced there on the spot. .!.!. Suddenly one realizes that the sensation is not one of space or an object in space. It has nothing to do with space and its manipulations. The sensation is the sensation of time-and all other multiple feelings vanish like the outside landscape.<BLOCKQUOTE>

After this experience, Newman continued to create paintings in the <I>Onement</I> series, including Oberlin's, many of which have titles that relate to mystical or biblical subjects and that have helped define his artwork as among the most important examples of postwar American abstraction.

Bold and colorful images like this, known as chitrakathā, or picture stories, were made in southern India in the 19th century and used as illustrations in public storytelling performances by a caste of wandering storytellers called Chitrakathis.

Because the illustrations were often based on local versions of the epics, specific identification of subjects is difficult today."

Works by Dan Flavin entered the collection in 1973, followed by Donald Judd (1968 & 1977), Sol LeWitt (1972), Robert Mangold (1972), and Robert Morris's <I>Untitled</I> (1969). These works allowed Oberlin students and the public to encounter firsthand emerging artists' explorations of new forms and new processes in art making, such as the use of modern technology, industrial materials, and fabrication methods. Largely acquired through the perspicacity of Oberlin College professor of art Ellen Johnson and AMAM curator of modern art Athena Tacha, Oberlin's Minimalist collection now boasts a core group of works by artists who are widely recognized for their major contributions in setting a new course for twentieth-century art.

""The sensuous object,"" Morris wrote in 1966, ""resplendent with compressed internal relations, has had to be rejected."" The object was to be replaced, Morris explained, by a ""unitary art form."" The AMAM's aluminum sculpture, installed in 1970 on the museum's north lawn, illustrates Morris's vision. Composed of eight rectangular units that were fabricated in a St. Paul, Minnesota, factory according to Morris's specifications, <I>Untitled</I> makes use of new industrial processes for its manufacture. Its spareness of form and hard metal surface together achieve Morris's intent to create a clear, logical structure. Ironically, in the end it is not the artist's hand but the surrounding environment that creates for the work a surprisingly organic visual beauty, most apparent when sunlight filters through the openings of its individual units.

Walter (OC 1957),Indian,,"India is home to some of the world's greatest sculpture traditions, which arose at different times in different parts of the country and were expressed in different media. The sculptures are primarily religious, and although each tradition has its own distinctive characteristics, they all share a common interest in capturing the vitality and gracefulness of their divine subjects. 
<br><br>
This sculpture depicts a standing Hindu divinity or <I>deva</I>. The figure is identifiable as a deity by his elaborate hairstyle, jewelry, and by the nimbus behind his head. Unfortunately, because the figure is weathered and missing some key pieces, it is impossible to tell exactly which deity it represents. The figure belongs to a famous group of sculptures that were discovered near the village of Tanesara in Rajasthan. The sculptures were carved around the middle of the sixth century and are notable for their naturalistic but idealized beauty. The well-proportioned, gently flexed body and delicate facial features of this sculpture are especially outstanding. Other related sculptures from the same group can be found in the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai, the British Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
<br><br>
The sculpture was donated to the AMAM in 1969 by Oberlin alumnus Paul F. Walter (OC 1957). Walter first began collecting art while he was still a student at Oberlin, and over the course of his life amassed important collections of Indian, Japanese, African, European, and American art.

In an 1845 self-portrait, now in the Detroit Institute of Arts, the artist depicted himself as a dashing young man conspicuously holding a paintbrush in his right hand.
<br><br>
After relocating to Ohio in 1854, Cohen found a loyal patron in Bentley Simons Runyan, a hardware merchant and entrepreneur who founded the Mansfield Gas Company and introduced gas lighting to the town. Runyan is shown here with his family, proudly posed in front of their luxurious, newly built Greek revival home. When Cohen completed the painting about 1857, the Runyans had only four children. A later artist added the couple's youngest daughter, Mary Ellen, born in 1859, in the curve of her mother's left arm. Other changes by this unknown artist include altering Bentley Runyan's left arm, originally depicted by Cohen as lifted to direct the viewer's gaze to the house (and now dropped to his side), and repainting the house from its original red brick color to a pale yellow green, as it may have been repainted in later years. 
<br><br>
Runyan commissioned at least three paintings from Cohen, including another in the AMAM collection, a portrait of his daughter Almeda Runyan from about 1856. Bentley Runyan was the grandfather of Mary Parsons McCullough, a 1907 Oberlin College graduate, whose husband James Caldwell McCullough taught chemistry at the College from 1907 through 1949. These two paintings formerly hung in their Oberlin home.

Working in pure, flat areas of color both in this work and in his paintings, it is perhaps not surprising that he also for a time worked as a designer of stained glass.  His interest in Oceanic art and the work of Gauguin is also apparent here; inspired by that artist, he had traveled to the South Seas in 1914, prior to serving in the First World War.

She returned to New York in 1965 and began work on Laocoön late that year. Constructed with a plastic pipe armature-with which she was assisted by sculptor Ray Donarski-Hesse cut and glued each of <I>Laocoön</I>'s stacked cubes by herself. She covered the pipes with cloth and papier-mâché, and painted them gray. Hesse made her ""snakes,"" as she called them, by wrapping wires first with cloth and again with thinner wire before painting them.
<br><br>
<I>Laocoön</I> stands about eight feet high and took many months to complete. Hesse made both preparatory drawings for the sculpture and continued to make drawings after it was completed. The title refers to the famous Hellenistic sculpture (now in the Vatican Museums) of the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons caught in the twisting, suffocating grip of pythons sent by the gods. Hesse visited Rome in 1964, and described in her datebook her visit to the Vatican Museums on September 19. 
<br><br>
In 1967, Professor Ellen Johnson invited Hesse to come to Oberlin as a Visiting Artist. Hesse arrived in January 1968 for a two-day visit and brought along new work. Johnson later wrote, ""when she brought out a whole stack of recent drawings, they were so beautiful that the Museum asked permission to exhibit them."" In 1970, the year of Hesse's death, the AMAM acquired <I>Laocoön</I>, the first Hesse sculpture acquired by a museum. Made in 1966, this key work-never exhibited publicly during the artist's lifetime-is today considered one of Hesse's most innovative and important sculptures.

Fabricated in an edition of three at the Lippincott factory in North Haven, Connecticut, the subject was chosen from several different models (including a soft monumental ice pack) the artist presented after a series of visits to Oberlin. The sculpture was commissioned by the AMAM in January 1969, installed on August 10, 1970, and dedicated on September 14 of that year. The two other editioned examples were executed later and are in the collections of the Saint Louis Art Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
<br><br>
In January 1963, Oldenburg participated -along with Joan Mitchell and Robert Rauschenberg-in the <I>Three Young Americans</I> exhibition at the museum. Ellen Johnson remarked in the 1963 <I>AMAM Bulletin</I> that Oldenburg's current work was more sculpture than painting, with a new interest in composing volumes. This exhibition and Oberlin's ongoing friendship with Oldenburg forged the way for the museum to work with the artist again in the late 1960s to commission a monumental sculpture. Plug developed from a concept that Oldenburg had already produced in different versions, notably hard and soft plugs suspended from above, with prongs pointing down. Much larger in scale, placed directly on the ground, and partly buried, Oberlin's <I>Plug</I> continues to engage powerfully the environment that surrounds it. Johnson described Oberlin as a place where people are intrigued and engaged with the sculpture and ""where everyone accepts that it is a serious work of art, which began when a major sculptor looked at a little twenty-five cent plug that the rest of us take for granted."" 
<br><br>
Among the multiple readings of the sculpture is the artist's suggestion that it could serve as a monument to Thomas Edison, who was born near Oberlin in Milan, Ohio. Oldenburg also remarked that if <I>Plug</I> were installed with the prongs embedded in the ground, the idea of contact, or plugging in, would have been lost.  
<br><br>
In 1970, during a visit to finalize the site, Oldenburg said, ""there are plugs lying around in drawers all over the world; they are nothing until contact is made."" For the 1970 installation, the bronze prongs pointed west toward Tappan Square, the large, treelined park directly across from the museum, effectively connecting the visual arts with the rest of the campus and the town of Oberlin. 
<br><br>
The artist's wit and whimsy came alive again for Oberlin when the Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown addition to the AMAM and Art Building was completed in 1977. The addition was in its early planning stages when Oldenburg's <I>Plug</I> was first sited, and he knew the sculpture would eventually be relocated. Oldenburg chose a new site in 1976, locating the <I>Plug</I> on a downward slope on the museum's southwest lawn, with the bronze prongs oriented toward the new art building. Oldenburg also responded to the new building in visual form with <I>Alternate Proposal</I> (AMAM 1979.29) , a design for the museum addition in the shape of mammoth three-way plugs linked together to form connected pods. 
<br><br>
Today, thanks to Ellen Johnson's 1998 bequest and gifts from many generous donors, there are thirty-eight sculptures, drawings, and prints by Oldenburg in the museum's collection. An outstanding recent gift, <I>Giant Saw-Soft Version (Saw Flag)</I>, from 1966, was presented to the museum in 2003 by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen in honor of Ellen Johnson.

(36 × 555 cm),,General Acquisitions Fund,Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"Mào Xiāng ranks among the most colorful characters in 17th-century China. Perhaps best known today as a poet and romantic, Mào also enjoyed considerable fame as a calligrapher during his own lifetime. He was a disciple of one of the most important calligraphers and painters of his age, Dǒng Qíchāng 董其昌(1555–1636).<br>
<br>
The text of the calligraphy, recounting a visit to West Lake near the city of Hangzhou, is a well-known vignette from a travelogue by poet and essayist Yuán Hóngdào 袁宏道 (1568–1610). Yuán was a central figure in a group of late Ming writers and poets who believed that good writing originated from genuine feeling and authentic experience, rather than from strict imitation of traditional literary models. Throughout his short life, Yuán sought to balance tradition and innovation and to keep his perception of the world fresh. Although he died a year before Mào was born, the younger man undoubtedly became familiar with Yuán's philosophy of life through their mutual friend, Dǒng Qíchāng. Mào's choice of this text is an interchange both with Yuán (in part because he was also a <i>bon vivant</i>) and with his teacher, Dǒng, whose style of calligraphy Mào strongly alludes to in this scroll."

The son of a goldsmith, Batoni began his career painting altarpieces for wealthy patrons in Rome, but by the 1750s, his skill as a portraitist was gaining ground. His depictions of sitters casually posed out of doors, surrounded by fragments of classical art and architecture, created a huge demand for this type of portrait. British visitors to Rome began to seek him out, hoping to have a record of their Grand Tour immortalized by the artist. 
<br><br>
Batoni's portrait of John Wodehouse, leaning with studied nonchalance on a pedestal, was painted in 1764 when the twenty-three-year-old sitter was in Rome on the Grand Tour (the painting was later inscribed with the incorrect date of 1762). Wodehouse was created 1st Baron Wodehouse of Kimberley in 1797 in recognition of his services as a Member of Parliament. 
<br><br>
Batoni used similar poses for many of his portraits; the pose he created here for Wodehouse is used in at least twelve other examples. He portrays him in an elegant blue silk suit trimmed with abundant gold braid and buttons, his gaze active, lips slightly parted. Wodehouse carries a sword, and the black ribbon at his neck is a ""solitaire,"" used to tie his wig. Vaguely defined Roman ruins are in the background, and beside Wodehouse is an accurate rendering of an impressive marble vase with a scene of revelry, that is today lost, but known from an early eighteenth-century publication. When Batoni initially painted the vase, he had included large handles on either side, but streamlined the finished painting by removing them, giving greater prominence to Wodehouse himself.

The Shahnameh covers the history of Persia and its people from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest in the 7th century. Its length runs to nine volumes, including over 50,000 verses.  Its literary content and vast temporal span covering many legendary and historical figures place the text among the masterpieces of world literature, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. With its emphasis on the concept of justice, the Shahnameh is an example of Muslim advice literature known as the “Mirror for Princes.”

This folio depicts the story of Piran, a nobleman of the region of Turan in Central Asia. In it the artist shows a keen interest in naturalistic representation as observed in the carefully modeled human and animal figures that are placed in a three-dimensional, receding space with naturalistic rock forms. The artist’s acute sense of light and shadow further enhances the psychological dimension of the painting as the two pairs of figures exchange words.

This sculpture is adorned with beautiful inlaid semi-precious stone earrings. Notice that the gold of the face is a slightly different color than the rest of the sculpture. Gilding of sculptures was typically done by mixing gold and mercury, painting the mixture on the sculpture, and then heating it to evaporate the mercury, repeating the process for an even tone.

Much less common are icons like this one, that portray Śākyamuni Buddha, the buddha of our era, wearing a crown and with his right hand in the earth-touching gesture (<i>bhūmisparśa mudrā<i>). Some scholars interpret the crown as representing the Buddha is his role as “Wheel-Turning King,” or <i>Ćakravartin<i>, the ideal of an enlightened universal ruler. In Crowned Śākyamuni icons, the Buddha still wears the simple robes of a monk, whereas the Five Tantric Buddhas wear the more complex robes of peaceful deities like bodhisattvas. <br>

Prentiss Fund,American,,"In the mid-1960s, Chuck Close abandoned his earlier abstract painting style for one more photo-based. In 1968, he began using passport-style images of himself, family, and friends to create colossal portrait heads that appear dispassionate and meticulously detailed even as they dissolve into quasi-pointillist painted areas when seen at close range. 
<br><br>
To start, Close overlaid a photograph with a grid and then transferred the image to canvas, square by square. Originally working only in black and white, he turned to color in 1970, limiting himself to the three primary colors, which he mixed together on the work's surface. His process was borrowed from commercial printing in which colors are produced by superimposing layers of transparent color. A transparency of red, blue, and yellow color separations would be made of the original photograph, with dye-transfer sheets produced from those in various combinations. Close used these as a guide in the coloring of the final work, which would be created with the use of numerous working drawings; the AMAM's <I>Study</I> is just one of several drawings for the final, monumental painting <I>Kent</I> (100 × 90 in.; Art Gallery of Ontario). In Oberlin's example, the three colors are shown separately at lower left, with twelve combinations in the same row. The transparent medium of watercolor allows the colors to be overlaid, rather than overtly mixed. 
<br><br>
In 1970, the year of this work, Close had one of his earliest exhibitions, <I>Three Young Americans</I>, at the AMAM, along with Ron Cooper and Neil Jenney. Such exhibitions of the work of emerging American artists were prevalent at Oberlin in the late 1950s, '60s, and '70s.

His broad knowledge of current developments in European art influenced his teaching, and for many students in New York in the 1930s and '40s, he came to embody the introduction of modern European art to America. Hofmann's influence on the Abstract Expressionists was great, and, in 1942, the year of this painting, he began experimenting with drip painting, and met Jackson Pollock. 
<br><br>
The saturated colors and strong gestures of <I>Landscape</I> attest to Hofmann's belief that the artist's medium and the space depicted in a work should be dynamic and appear to be constantly shifting; in this way, they anticipate the effects of color and composition in many works from the late 1940s and '50s. Although it appears nonrepresentational, the viewer still gets a sense of its subject, a landscape. Hofmann stated, 

<blockquote>Art does not consist in the objectified imitation of reality. .!.!. [F]orm receives its impulse from nature, but it is nevertheless not bound to objective reality; rather it depends to a much greater extent on the artistic experience evoked by objective reality and the artist's command of the spiritual means of the fine arts, through which this artistic experience is transformed by him into reality in painting. Creative expression is thus the spiritual translation of inner concepts into form.</blockquote> 

The painting was purchased from Oberlin alumnus André Emmerich (1924-2007), who was an important gallery owner in New York, working both with Color Field painters and other contemporary artists, as well as with Central and South American works of art.

(18.7 × 23.5 cm),,Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Carl Kinney,American,,"Ansel Adams's youthful dream of becoming a concert pianist was eventually replaced by a lifelong pursuit of photography. His lyrical, sublime landscapes of the American West transcend mere fact to express the symphonic in nature. Adams began taking photographs around 1916, when his parents gave him a small Brownie camera. After meeting photographers Edward Weston in 1927 and Paul Strand in 1930, he abandoned his earlier pictorial style for ""pure"" photography. In 1932, Adams and six other San Francisco photographers-Imogen Cunningham, John Paul Edwards, Sonya Noskowiak, Henry Swift, Willard Van Dyke, and Weston-created a group they called <I>f/64</I>, after the large-format view camera's smallest aperture, which provides the greatest depth of field. The group exhibited together only once, at San Francisco's De Young Museum in 1932; later that year, Adams had his first one-man show there. 
<br><br>
Adams experimented with different cameras and techniques, using papers with a high gloss, employing long exposures with the aperture set at f/64, and pioneering a system that enabled him to capture an impressive range of light values based on a scale of ten zones ranging from black to white. In determining his compositions and exposures, Adams exploited the critical role that can be played by middle tones. <I>Noon Clouds</I> is a spectacular example of Adams's use of his zone system to capture-with remarkable clarity-both near and far details, while also suggesting the transient nature of the cumulus clouds floating above the mountains. 
<br><br>
Adams exerted full control over the development of his images, including their final printing. Brilliant in description and technical precision, photographs like this one celebrate his deep reverence for nature. A preservationist who joined the Sierra Club at the age of seventeen, Adams made powerful photographs of some of the country's most dramatic landscapes. They remain as popular today as they were in his lifetime.

<br><br>
His small-scale sculptural groups, like the AMAM example, recall the twisted, elongated forms of his sixteenth-century predecessor Giambologna in their weightlessness, displaying compositions that often require the viewer to move around them in order to fully appreciate their complexity. As art historian Charles Avery has noted, Bertos's skill in working marble led to a charge by the Inquisition in the 1730s that his sculptures were so elaborate that he must have been assisted by the devil; it seemed impossible that anyone could create such gravity defying figures. 
<br><br>
This dynamic, spiral, and pyramidal composition depicts Icarus, who had wings affixed to his back with wax in an attempt to escape Crete with his father, Daedalus. The sun melted the wax and Icarus tumbled to the earth. The figure on the ground is likely a river god, given the urn of water flowing at his side, symbolic of the sea into which Icarus fell; a feather has fallen onto his head. The piece as a whole may represent Fire and Water, as a set of two other known works-showing the Fall of Icarus, and Proserpine and Pluto-is thought to symbolize Fire and Water, Air and Earth.

The AMAM collection is rich in small bronzes from the Renaissance and Baroque, including two versions of Giambologna's <I>Mercury</I>, and this magnificent sculpture by Bertos continues this tradition into the eighteenth century.

The work's powerful, close-knit grouping represents a return to canonical High Renaissance images of the Holy Family, away from more complex, Mannerist composition.

These materials also accrued biographical or literary meaning; both fat and felt, for example, figured in a partially fabricated story Beuys told of being rescued by nomadic Tatars after crashing his plane in Crimea during World War II.

In the so-called “crash story” and in many of Beuys’s sculptures, felt serves insulating, protecting, and healing functions, making it the ideal material for a suit that could envelop the whole body. Modeled after one of Beuys’s own suits (with the sleeves and legs elongated), Felt Suit was produced in an edition of 100 and sold for a relatively modest sum. Beuys donned a version of the suit in a Fluxus performance with Terry Fox and again in a demonstration in Switzerland, but expressed utter indifference as to how it was displayed by his collectors, telling one of his publishers, “I don’t give a damn.

While in Taos in 1956, Martin met New York gallery owner Betty Parsons, who represented New York School artists Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, and Ad Reinhardt. As a result of the meeting, Martin returned to New York where she lived along the East River on Coenties Slip, in the same building as artists Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Indiana. Martin was fascinated by the views of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge. Her first two solo New York shows (at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1958 and 1959) comprised abstract paintings that make direct references in their titles to her engagement with nature.

Martin began making her ""grid"" paintings in 1960, and <I>East River</I> is a prime example of what would become the artist's signature early style. Its serene, contemplative beauty-executed in gray oil paint on primed canvas with the grid drawn in pencil across the wet paint-belies the rigorous work and discipline behind its creation. Carefully drawn horizontal lines are separated by five vertical lines, which, when combined with the edges of the canvas, create six individual panels. Alternatively, the vertical line bisecting the painting suggests a diptych. Although Martin's work was associated with the Minimalists-she was a friend of Barnett Newman, who installed her shows at the Betty Parsons Gallery, and Ad Reinhardt- she herself preferred to think of her work as more closely aligned with artists of the Abstract Expressionist generation.

(60 × 20 × 20 cm),,Fund for Contemporary Art,American,,"Made with simple, freestanding geometric forms and based on a specific order and serial imagery, Sol LeWitt's <I>49 Three-Part Variations</I> on Three Different Kinds of Cubes was acquired by the AMAM early in LeWitt's career, when he was experimenting with a variety of floor pieces that developed from his wall drawings. This piece belongs to a group of works, dating from 1967 through 1969, executed in aluminum and painted. The first in this series was <I>47 Three-Part Variations on Three Different Kinds of Cubes</I>, exhibited at the Dwan Gallery in New York (it was later destroyed by the artist because of fabrication problems). Although this earlier, 1967 piece was composed of forty-seven variations and incorporated larger cubes that were connected at the base, both it and the AMAM piece employ three types of cubes: a solid cube, a cube with two opposite sides removed, and a cube with one side removed. LeWitt intended the variations to represent all possible three-part combinations, but as he discovered that there were in fact even more possible combinations, he produced several succeeding versions, culminating in <I>All Three-Part Variations on Three Different Kinds of Cubes</I> (1969), which included fifty-six variations. 
<br><br>
LeWitt's exploration of this theme took several different forms: individual drawings, drawings in book form, and three-dimensional pieces. ""In conceptual art, the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work,"" LeWitt wrote. He further maintained that none of these should be viewed as the work itself but merely as a physical realization of an idea: ""The idea itself, even if not made visual, is as much a work of art as any finished product."" LeWitt also declared that when a work is made in three dimensions, the material in which the work is realized should not draw attention to itself so as to ""engage the mind of the viewer rather than his eye or emotions.""
<br><br>
In 2006, <I>49 Three-Part Variations</I> was restored in consultation with the artist and shown in a 2007 exhibition, <I>Sol LeWitt at the AMAM</I>, along with works on loan from the LeWitt Collection. When LeWitt died at the age of seventy-eight, shortly after the exhibition opened, it became a memorial to the artist and his legacy.

Walter (OC 1957),Tibetan,,"In Indo-Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, complex rituals and forms of meditation are utilized to alleviate the suffering of an unenlightened existence by leading practitioners to the realization that all perceived phenomena are inherently empty (śūnyatā). One such practice involves maṇḍala (Tibetan: dkyil-‘khor), a term that most often refers to a cosmogram, or geometric representation of a spiritual universe. Often the maṇḍala centers on a specific deity in the form of which tantric adepts visualize themselves, embodying the deity’s perspective on the reality to which the maṇḍala points. In this case, that deity is Hevajra Kapāladhara, or the Skullcup-holding Hevajra.<br>
<br>
The flat, geometric forms of this maṇḍala are understood by the practitioner to represent a three-dimensional, architectural space, the palace of Hevajra. The square walls of the palace open to the cardinal directions with elaborate T-shaped gates, a structure repeated in each of the five chapels within the palace walls. A different aspect of Hevajra stands at the center of each chapel, locked in an embrace with his consort Nairātmyā."

The print captures the urgency and horror felt during the plague epidemic of 1630–31. Communal petitions to Mary and the saints to intercede with Christ so that he would no longer avenge the people’s sins were widely orchestrated by local civic and religious authorities. Details of the scene, such as the child on the bridge holding his nose, not only allude to the corpses below, but tie the scene directly to symptoms of plague, in which oozing buboes cause a foul stench.

The main image of the print is straightforward in its depiction of Medea chopping up Absyrtus on the deck of the Argo.

(41.3 × 38.4 × 9.5 cm),,Fund for Contemporary Art,American,,"One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, Marcel Duchamp is best known for his “readymades,” works of sculpture that consist of everyday objects—a bottle drying rack, bicycle wheel, shovel, and urinal, among others—displayed as-is or with minimal intervention. Seemingly simple and even tongue-in-cheek, Duchamp’s readymades in fact pressed on some of art history’s major philosophical issues: they questioned distinctions between art and non-art, and proposed that an artist could elevate an ordinary thing to the status of art by selecting it from the store and placing it in an exhibition context.<br>
<br>
First produced in 1941 and released in various iterations thereafter, Duchamp’s <i>Boîte-en-valise</i> (Box in a Suitcase) is a miniature museum of small-scale replicas of his ready-mades, paintings, drawings, and sculptures. <i>Boîte</i> is full of contradictions that play up the issues of reproduction and originality at the center of Duchamp’s oeuvre. Art historian Martha Buskirk points out that, unlike the works on which they are based, the objects in Boîte are “decidedly not mass-produced,” most of them created instead through “a much more elaborate, careful, and labor-intensive process.” She adds, “Paradoxically, given the assumption that one effect of mechanical reproduction is to bring the work of art to the viewer,” Duchamp had to travel to see many of the works in person, and even had to repurchase one of them in order to have it to reproduce."

The initial popularity of Dürer's <i>Apocalypse</i> series of 1498 can be partially attributed to the prevalence of this idea, as the artist's contemporaries frequently anticipated the apocalyptic events described in St. John's Revelations. Dürer's series gives visual form to this biblical account, which the artist translated into fifteen large woodblock prints. In a literal rendition of the text, Dürer shows St. John devouring the Word of God, handed down to him by an angel with a body of clouds, flaming pillars for legs, and with sunlight emanating from his face. Dürer's lively composition elicits the mystery of the apocalyptic events that were surely on the minds of this print's Renaissance viewers."

Typical of her complex oeuvre, <i>Dialectic Triangulation</i> examines the method of triangulation, whereby the location and measurement of a point is determined by forming triangles from other known points, in both mathematical and philosophical terms. In discussing her rationale for including this shape in her work, Denes once said: “[Pyramids] have little to do with their Egyptian ancestors; rather, they represent social structures in the form of a visual philosophy that convey ecological, social, and cultural issues. Their purpose is to respond to humanity’s crucial concerns, and to seek benign solutions to them.” For Denes, the pyramid represents the tool through which she determines the threefold nature of such philosophical and scientific concepts as ethics, logic, genetics, and evolution."

Bodhisattva",Mrs. F. F. Prentiss Fund,Tibetan,Guge Kingdom (ca. 10th–17th centuries),"Padmapāṇi means “lotus holder,” and was another name for Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva who represents the vast compassion of all of the buddhas. Here, Padmapāṇi holds the stem of a lotus in their proper left hand, and the blossom rests by their left shoulder. Because the lotus is a beautiful flower that rises on a long stem out of muddy ponds, it became a symbol of purity in South Asian religions. In Buddhism the lotus represents the enlightened mind that rises above the ignorance, attachment, and aversion that keep us tied to our world of suffering (<i>Saṃsāra</i>).<br>
<br>
 As an earthly emanation of the buddha Amitābha, Avalokiteśvara can often be identified by a small image of that buddha in their crown, seen here. Another common feature is the deerskin (<i>krishnasara</i>) worn on one shoulder. In Buddhist art deer (<i>mriga</i>, sometimes antelopes) are rich in meaning, referring to the Deer Park where Shakyamuni Buddha first preached; they also symbolize a fearful being that has conquered fear in the presence of the Buddhist teachings (<I>Dharma</i>). The bodhisattva’s right hand is in the gesture granting fearlessness (<i>abhaya mudrā</i>).<br>

Devotees believe the statue is the Virgin Mary herself and attribute miraculous capacities to it. Through devotion to wooden statues like Roldàn’s, believers hope to bring about positive change in their lives.<br>
<br>
Flack highlights the precious jewels, lace, and gold that have been added to the sculpture over time, representing them as if they are apart from the figure, suggesting that the Macarena’s power emanates from within. Flack’s work, though large, resembles the qualities of a postcard (the way in which Flack was first introduced to the sculpture). Through its mode of reproduction, Flack effectively demonstrates a widely held Catholic belief: that replication enhances, rather than detracts from, the power of miraculous objects."

Her extensive notebooks document her thoughts and influences, from philosophy to the natural world.

Many of Morton's early installations were lost or destroyed, and are known only through photographs. The AMAM's work is a rare, early piece, composed of nine branches supported by two forked branches, all painted, framing a drawing on canvas. Its construction seems to reference a primitive shelter or an altar, and is evidence of Morton's desire to connect painting, sculpture, and installation in a highly personal way. During 1971-73, when the AMAM piece was produced, many of her works were architectural or cartographic in character. In her notebook, just after the pages that relate to Oberlin's piece, are notes about ritual killings in Celtic mythology and in Roman Gaul, discussing burnings in ""cages of wood"" and in ""huge wicker-work images.""

Olney Fund,English,,"Frederick Sandys's voluptuous drawing, executed in rich black and red chalk, is one of a small number of Pre-Raphaelite works in the AMAM collection. Active as a draftsman and illustrator as well as a painter, Sandys was educated first by his father and then at the Norwich School of Design. He relocated from his birthplace of Norwich to London by 1851, the year he first showed at the Royal Academy of Art. He exhibited regularly at the Academy until 1886. 
<br><br>
Sandys first met the Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1857, when he asked to draw Rossetti's portrait. Although the portrait was intended for Sandys's wood engraving <I>A Nightmare</I>-a satirical reading of Sir John Everett Millais's painting,<I> A Dream of the Past, Sir Isumbras at the Ford</I>-Sandys and Rossetti became friends. The two lived together at Rossetti's Cheyne Walk home for much of the year in 1866, but their friendship dissolved in 1869 when Rossetti accused Sandys of plagiarizing his art. 
<br><br>
<I>Red Rose and White</I> is a superb example of Sandys's virtuosity as a draftsman. It also illustrates how he was able both to mythologize a type and to retain an acute specificity of characterization. From the late 1860s, Sandys made a series of drawings of almost life-size female heads, many depicting his muse and mistress, the actress Mary Emma Jones, who performed under the stage name ""Miss Clive."" Widely admired for her luxuriously thick, curly hair, she first sat for Sandys in 1862. In this sensuous drawing, two full-bloom roses are buried in her hair, and her right hand plays languorously with the mass of curls falling over her shoulder. Sandys sketched a mere suggestion of the neckline of Jones's dress, focusing instead on her partly opened mouth and her eyes, which gaze directly at the viewer. In 1867, the year this drawing was made, the couple was living together and Jones gave birth to the first of their nine children.

Miller Jr. Fund,Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"Xiao Yuncong was born into an aristocratic family from Wuhu in Anhui province. After the Manchu conquest of China in 1644, he abandoned all hope of an official career and retired to a hermit's existence of scholarship, poetry, and painting. He was a major figure in the development of the Anhui school of painting.

Stylistic elements of the Anhui school of painting are evident in landscapes from Xiao Yuncong's mature period. His works also reveal the influence of the Orthodox school in the numerous art-historical allusions to the style of the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269-1354). By combining these different elements of Orthodox- and Anhui-school painting, Xiao was able to imprint his own distinctive identity onto this scroll. Such individualism is typical of Xiao's oeuvre.

Xiao Yuncong's poem at the end of this scroll is not a straightforward description of the painted scenery, but its imagery resonates with the landscape preceding it and enhances the viewer's appreciation of the picture:

From a verdant valley I gazed upon the southern mountains, 
Shimmering azure-green before my eyes.
Seized by inspiration I visited Deer Gate,
Nestled in seclusion, up through Drake Gorge.
My lofty tracks could not be followed,
Only white clouds accompanied me, broken intermittently.
I felt as if I were at the end of the world,
Autumn colors infused the scenery, like the veins in a piece of jade.

A falling tree echoed among the empty crags,
A pure breeze carried the sounds of a jade waterfall.
Mists swirled about, rustling beneath the pines,
Where I gathered an armful of mountain chrysanthemums.
Walking with my staff I headed west across a bridge,
Among the jade-white blossoms growing on foothills beneath the peaks.
Immortals delight in such lofty abodes,
Basking in the moonlight, they enjoy their seclusion.
River water rages to green at Heaven's Gate,
Stone lotuses grow in princely households.
Where once upon a time they summoned painting masters,
And drank with them fresh spring wine.

(30 × 23 cm),,Fund for Contemporary Art,French,,"Arman is best known for his sculptures of accumulated objects; this drawing of hand guns repeated in a pattern is thus unusual in terms of the artist's medium and technique, but it takes up larger themes that he consistently explored in his works. Despite its two dimensions, this drawing can also be seen as an accumulation of recognizable objects. Arman, inspired by the work of Kurt Schwitters, rejected Abstract Expressionism and lyrical abstraction in the 1950s, and turned to an art form that was highly depersonalized and mechanized. He favored the Dada movement, compiling found objects to modify their meaning by repetition. This emphasis on repetition can clearly be seen in this drawing, but unlike in many of his other works, here the artist's hand is readily apparent."

The focus is not on the illusionistic vault, which is only partially rendered at the top of the sheet, but on the narrow space between it and the upper wall.  The theme of the gallery is the triumph of love over mortals and gods alike, and depicted here are, from left to right, Pyramus and Thisbe; a satyr; Bacchus and Ariadne; Mercury, Pan, and Syrinx; Neptune; and Nessus and Deianeira.  The squaring of the right half suggests that this was the final state of the design before it was transposed to the upper wall and vault, yet it also reveals that Ferrari was still considering alternate decorative systems for the architecture: on the right-hand side of the drawing, dentils are featured in the cornice above the pilasters, while on the left-hand side, palmettes are used. For the final articulation of the continuous band, Ferrari chose the more festive palmettes."

At the core of the work is a simple square made of four two-foot-long logs, joined with invisible notches and painstakingly bound together by the artist with thousands of feet of twine that she had unraveled from strands of weathered rope. She wrapped, bound, and knotted the twine around the wooden frame, transforming its geometry into an eccentric form of enormous density, weight, and textural and linear intricacy. The artist believed that the process of making the work—and her role in that process—were critical to its success.
<br><br>
In a New York Times review of Winsor’s 1979 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Hilton Kramer noted a connection between the artist’s work, “with its attachment to ritual and pre-industrial modes of workmanship,” and what was then called “primitive”:
<br><br>
“There is a yearning in [Winsor’s] work for the kind of meaning that the sculpture in a primitive culture could take for granted: the meaning that derives from a traditionally ordained ritual function. It is in this yearning that the true significance of Jackie Winsor’s sculpture lies—a yearning that attempts to convert the slick forms of Minimalism back into the language of primitive feeling. The poignancy of the work is to be found in the fact that the only rituals available to the sculpture in this task are the rituals of esthetic ratiocination.”
<br><br>
Ellen Johnson, in her catalogue essay for the 1979 exhibition, seemed to concur with Kramer’s response:
<br><br>
“The whole slow process Winsor likened to a ritual long before that reference became so hackneyed. The earlier all-rope series she had executed entirely alone, but the bound-log pieces grew too large and heavy for one person to handle…In the rope pieces Winsor joins hands, as it were, with the original makers and users of the twisted hemp. Such a notion would not, I think, be scoffed at by Winsor inasmuch as she actually invites spectators to bring their own associations to their understanding of her work.”

After attending the University of Louisville (receiving a BA and MA in Fine Arts) and teaching art in the Louisville public schools, Gilliam relocated to Washington, DC, in 1961. There, he was influenced by the Washington Color Painters, including Morris Louis and Gene Davis, who from the mid-1950s created abstract canvases based on color relationships. Gilliam became well known for the direct immediacy of his experimental paintings and watercolors, which explored patterns of color on folded paper and canvas at a time when Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptual art dominated the New York art world. 
<br><br>
Gilliam gave the AMAM this major work three years after he was invited to Oberlin in March 1970 as an artist-in-residence. <I>Softly Still</I> is one of his classic ""Draped"" paintings. These radically innovative works liberated the canvas from the realm of easel painting, fashioning them into free-form installations. Gilliam soaked a canvas in brilliant pinks, greens, reds, and yellow-orange, and, draping the whole over a wooden sawhorse, created a piece that resonates with poetic harmony. Each time the work is placed on view, it takes on a slightly different form and appearance. The five yards of canvas that Gilliam used to create <I>Softly Still</I> are bulky and difficult to manipulate. Ironically, when the work is installed, it creates a monumental sculpture with a great sense of weightlessness. The sawhorse itself references the mass- produced tool used by carpenters, but Gilliam made this one himself.

If you look very closely, you can see tiny pin-prick holes all along those final lines. This is a technique called “pouncing,” used to transfer a drawing. A painter lays the drawing on the final surface and then pats a small bag filled with coal dust on the drawing, forcing the dust through the small holes and leaving an outline of the composition on the new surface, to be finished with lines and colors."

Relaxed stances like this one were considered more appropriate to bodhisattvas and their dynamic intercession in our world. Buddhas tend to be portrayed in a more formal seated posture.<br>

This figure would have held the stem of the lotus that rests by the left shoulder; sadly, that stem has been lost, making the left-hand gesture a little confusing.

Picking a specific space, Mangold would depict every detail of the floor, from the wood grain to scuff marks and knotholes. In 1974 she said, ""The pattern of the floor was my structure. The structure was calculated and drawn first. The painting of the wood grain was spontaneous and true to the organic forms of nature.

The series includes definitions for words such as “water,” “art,” “painting,” and even “definition” itself, all in an effort to demonstrate the failure of language to constitute the equivalent of what it purports to describe—the printed definition of water, for example, offers something different than a painting or photograph of water, which still is not the same as the physical experience of water."

The medium's rich tonal range suited the drama of subjects such as Belshazzar's Feast and The Fall of Babylon, which he engraved after two of his most important paintings.  The hand-coloring attests the mezzotints' popularity, as it was probably added by the publisher during a later issuing to mask areas of the plate worn by earlier printings.  Together, they tell the story of Babylon's destruction: the Persian siege of the city depicted in The Fall of Babylon is prophesized by a black-cloaked Daniel in the center foreground of Belshazzar's Feast."

(152.5 × 79 cm),,Fund for Contemporary Art,American,,"In the early 1970s, Michelle Stuart began working on large-scale paper scrolls that used frottage (a rubbing technique) to capture the topography of the Earth’s surface. Some of these drawings were made with dirt, while others, including this one, were rendered with graphite. They were inspired by Stuart’s work as a cartographic draftsperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as by her experience of the ubiquitous photographs of the moon that circulated in the 1960s, the products of a series of NASA missions culminating in the moon landing. Stuart has since turned primarily to photography, a process that, like her rubbings, is based on the notion of the index, in which the work is a record of what it physically encounters.<br>
<br>
Unlike many canonical examples of Land art, Stuart’s drawings rely on an intimate relationship between the artist’s hand and the earth, which led many early critics of her work to align it with explicitly feminist practices that emphasized the body. Stuart’s ultimate interest is in the traces we leave on the Earth, and the Earth’s reciprocal shaping of our identities. As she has put it, “We imprint and are imprints of all that came before.”

In contrast to the persistent realism of such subjects, Siqueiros also made a profound impact on the development of abstraction in the United States and Mexico. In his Experimental Workshop in New York in 1936, for example, Siqueiros instructed participants, including future Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock, in such innovative art-making techniques as the use of the airbrush and industrial paints.

Tepper,Japanese,,"Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama is known for her use of organic motifs and obsessively repeated patterns, and her highly individual works bear strong affinities with both Pop and minimalism. Born to a prosperous family in Matsumoto City, Kusama studied at the Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts for a year. She was intrigued by America and corresponded with painter Georgia O'Keeffe before relocating to New York City in 1958. In 1962 (the year Claes Oldenburg also began to make soft sculptures), Kusama began appropriating everyday objects and covering them with handmade forms; she often used phallic forms, and such works became parts of her ""Sex-Obsession"" and ""Compulsion Furniture"" series. Kusama said that as a woman, a phallus was something she feared. By manipulating and controlling them, she was able to keep this fear at bay. 
<br><br>
This work, a baby carriage covered in soft phalluses, was created in 1964 predominantly in a red material covered in white polka dots, with a smaller number of the protrusions covered in a black- and- white striped material. It was exhibited at the Richard Castellane Gallery in New York in November 1965, next to another Kusama piece, a female mannequin covered in rotelle pasta painted white (<I>Macaroni Girl</I>), with blue and purple slipperlike objects nearby on the floor. Of polka dots, the artist proclaimed in 1968, ""The polka dot has the form of the sun, signifying masculine energy, the source of life. The polka dot has the form of the moon, symbolizing the feminine principle of reproduction and growth. Polka dots suggest multiplication to infinity."" In 1966, shortly after the show closed, Kusama reworked <I>Baby Carriage</I>, painting it in metallic silver and adding the three kangaroos; the artist later recalled that she did this as it had become dirty while on display. Today, the red and white material shows through in certain areas. 
<br><br>
Joseph Cornell was her great friend, mentor, and would-be lover (""I disliked sex, and he was impotent; we suited each other very well,"" Kusama later recalled), and after his 1972 death she chose to leave New York, moving back to Japan. 
<br><br>

This work, one of an edition of 40, is made up of 100 tiles that may be variously arranged. Through it the artist investigates how colors can create the illusion of depth and transparency although on a flat, opaque surface. Color energy, or the effect of the interaction of two juxtaposed colors on the optic nerve, is the central device: yellow, orange, and red dominate and seem to pulsate, limited by thin bands of green, blue, and purple. By varying the widths of the warm-colored bands, the artist produced the illusion of these intense hues diminishing as they are tempered by their complements. Although from a distance the colors seem to fade closer to their edges, all of the lines are precise and rigid."

The wild, irregular patterns assembled from divergent fabrics and embellished with hand-sewn embroidery are said to have been inspired by forms found in Asian textiles on view in the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. The integration of local materials, such as the ribbon celebrating the annual reunion of the 6th Ohio Volunteer Veteran Cavalry serving in the Civil War, with foreign-inspired forms like the fan shapes and the metallic “Japanese” gold thread, points to the practice of melding various sources to create this uniquely American quilt.

She graduated in 1916 and took up several apprenticeships before joining the Viennese Photographic Society in 1919. She opened her own studio in 1920—the year she took this pensive portrait of the Viennese society figure Lotte Franzos, who was known for hosting artists, writers, and politicians at her salon.<br>
 <br>
Fleishmann was one of several successful Jewish women photographers in interwar Vienna who benefitted from perceptions of photography as a commercial trade rather than a form of fine art. Fleishmann never married and maintained romantic relationships with women throughout her life, as well as mentoring and supporting younger women photographers.<br>
 <br>
In the interwar period, Fleischmann’s portraits of celebrities and entertainers were published in popular German-language magazines. In 1925, a Berlin attorney accused her of indecency for her sensual portraits of dancers. Fleeing Nazi persecution in 1938, Fleishmann emigrated to Paris, London, and then New York, where she operated a studio in midtown Manhattan from 1940 to 1969 producing work for clients including <i>Vogue</i>"

On that occasion, Miss created the first version of this work, made of wooden slats that protruded directly from the soil along the sides of a square hole cut into the ground on the northeast lawn of the museum. After the exhibition, AMAM director Richard Spear discussed with Miss the possibility of creating the piece in permanent materials; it was to become the artist's first permanent commissioned work, and is her earliest extant public work. Constructed in the summer of 1975 under the artist's supervision, this second version was created with steel slats protruding from tinted concrete, in its original siting. 
<br><br>
Mary Miss's sculptural work always makes clear reference to its environmental surroundings. This sculpture resembles a trap and is meant to be encountered without warning. The top edges of the concrete were beveled to allow the sod to grow over them, and its flatness and grid pattern, with repeating slats forming a design that changes with light and shade, evoke the landscape of Oberlin-a town of flat terrain created on a north-south-east-west grid.
<br><br>
Its structure demands interaction-it can only be viewed when one is practically on top of it-just as the process through which it was created called for the interaction of both Oberlin students and staff members. Seemingly inconspicuous, and without the monumentality of the AMAM's outdoor <I>Untitled</I> by Robert Morris or its <I>Giant Three-Way Plug</I> by Claes Oldenburg, it instead confronts the viewer with a sculpture-in-reverse-one that appears to extend indefinitely under the ground.

A painter and designer, Bell was the sister of writer Virginia Woolf, and with her sister and others, including Fry, formed the Bloomsbury Group of writers, intellectuals and artists in early 20th-century London.  Fry, an artist perhaps best known as a curator, art critic and champion of modern art, coined the term ""post-impressionism""; in the years bracketing this work, 1910 and 1912, he organized the first prominent exhibitions of Gauguin, Van Gogh, Manet and Matisse in England."

Roberts and Marcia Roberts in honor of Dr. Wolfgang Stechow,Caucasian,Ottoman Period (c.1299 - 1922),"Woven textiles traditionally occupied a central role in the lives of the nomadic and seminomadic tribal peoples of Western and Central Asia. Produced mainly from locally available sheep and goat wool, these textiles were used for shelter, clothing, and all manner of household furnishings. This large, flat-woven textile was probably used by its original owners as a floor covering or eating mat on special occasions. It was woven in two sections that were later sewn together down the middle. It features a brocaded design of stylized dragons that ultimately derives from thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Chinese silk textiles. Brocaded coverings of this type are often ascribed to the Shahsavan, a Turkic people who are now found mainly in northwestern Iran. The name Shahsavan means ""those who love the Shah,"" and according to legend, the Shahsavan are descended from tribes who helped the monarch Shah Abbas (1589- 1629) secure the foundations of the Persian Safavid dynasty in the sixteenth century. The Shahsavan tribes include a mix of nomadic, seminomadic, and settled clans, and their weavings have historically been traded over a wide area within the larger Caucasus region. 
<br><br>
The cover belongs to a much larger collection of Western and Central Asian tribal textiles that were donated to the AMAM by Elyria, Ohio, businessman Ernie Roberts. An oral tradition attached to the cover says that it was once used to wrap a portion of the famous Pergamon altar when it was shipped from Turkey to Germany in the late nineteenth century. In Germany, the cover came into the possession of an artist named Louis Jacoby, a member of a family who later emigrated to Oberlin. Gertrud Jacoby eventually sold the weaving to the eminent Oberlin art historian Wolfgang Stechow, who in turn sold it to Roberts. Unfortunately, there is no way to confirm this alluring story, but it adds a further element of mystique to the cover's already considerable aesthetic power.

<br><br>
Here, Degas may have been inspired by photography (he was a photographer himself), or by Japanese woodcuts (he owned a sizeable collection of them). Although he did not adopt the picturesque Japanese motifs and ornament, he was intimately familiar with and used the compositional arrangement of Japanese prints in his work. Closely cropped at the edges, Mary Cassatt is shown in a tightly enclosed space with the figures viewed from a slightly elevated position, reminiscent of Japanese pillar prints that were designed in a narrow vertical format.

The absorption on his friend's face as she studies her book, and the narrow vertical format that abruptly cuts off the figures, are evocative of the experimental ""snapshot"" aesthetic of Degas's printmaking.

Here, in a scene based on a grisaille by Maerten van Heemskerck, Vulcan and his assistants are shown forging a wing for his son Cupid, while the boy and his mother Venus look on. A popular subject in Renaissance art, Vulcan’s crafting of the wing shows that even the most ethereal things—poetry, love, spiritual ascent—might owe something to rather more muscular acts of construction. Even before the Scientific Revolution, myths like these demonstrated confidence that knowledge of the world was continuous with and emergent from the body.

Using lead oxide as a flux in the glaze created a lower melting point, and the colors came from the addition of copper oxide to produce green and iron oxide for browns and yellows, set off by the white of the clay body. Random glaze movement arose from drifting wood ash in the kiln, which fell unpredictably and reacted with the glaze. Wax resist was often used to limit the flow of glazes in certain areas and create patterns, such as the circles around the vessel’s shoulders.

In this plate Tom is in Bedlam (the Royal Bethlehem Hospital), having been committed after losing his mind.

The Rake is profligate and spends his newfound fortune, initially on the trappings of a wealthy gentleman, and then later upon whores and in taverns, where it is quickly lost, stolen, or gambled away. The print shows the Rake in his last days, as a raving madman in London’s famous Bedlam Hospital. Although Bedlam was celebrated for its clean, open spaces and its success at rehabilitating two-thirds of its patients, here it appears to be a chaotic site for men and women with disturbed fantasies. Patients are hardly soothed or uplifted by restorative surroundings. Hogarth’s series promises social healing by calling attention to the frivolity, cruelty, and superficiality of both aristocrats and those who ape them."

Wager Bequest,English,,"<I>The Bench</I> alludes to Hogarth's concern with corrupt judges in the Court of Common Pleas, and with the metaphor of judgment in both moral and aesthetic matters. The print is closely tied to The Analysis of Beauty, specifically the long-nosed judge, who appears there in Plate 1 as an exemplar of disguised stupidity and poor judgement in art. The row of caricatured heads at the top was added by Hogarth to further clarify the distinction between Character and Caricature.<br>
<br>
Hogarth's tongue-in-cheek study of wigs links the eighteenth-century rage for Vitruvius, which would deduce laws of composition and canons of beauty from the measure of ancient columns or statues, with the outlandish hairdos affected by fashionable society. The periwigs are arranged in various ""orders"": Episcopal, Old Peerian or Aldermanic (worn by peers and city officials), Lexonic (lawyers), Composite or Half Natural, and Queerinthian or Queue de Renard (Corinthian, the most elaborate, worn by consummate dandies).

The print also gestures self-reflexively to Hogarth’s own artistic career.

The Viscount seeks medical assistance from the quack, Monsieur de la Pillule (as inscribed on the books in left foreground), who stands by a table on which rests a skull, a clear indication that this doctor’s remedies will only hasten death. The doctor has sometimes been identified as John Misaubin (1673-1734), a successful physician who was often derided by his contemporaries for his concoctions and pills.

(23 × 18 cm),Oval composition with a dark blue painted rectangular frame.,Gift of Paul F. Walter (OC 1957),Indian,Mughal Dynasty (1526 - 1858),"Kangra was a princely state in the so-called Pahari region in the Himalayan foothills of northern India. The Pahari region was home to a number of closely related painting schools in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These painting schools were all descended from a courtly painting tradition that was brought to India from Iran by the Mughals in the early sixteenth century. As Mughal power weakened in the late seventeenth century, court painters sought patronage in some of the princely Rajput courts that coexisted with the Mughals, and many new regional styles were born. 
<br><br>
Kangra painters were known for their use of highly refined mineral colors that often gave their images an almost jewellike quality. They specialized in romantic and erotic themes and were highly adept at depicting nocturnal and other atmospheric scenes. This image of a richly dressed woman sitting with a companion on a palace terrace as dark storm clouds loom overhead is an excellent example of Kangra painting. The subject is not conclusively identified, but it may depict an episode from Jayadeva Goswami's epic twelfth-century poem <I>Gita Govinda</I>, in which the former cow-maid Radha and her servant watch an approaching storm and imagine that it is the arrival of her lover, Krishna. The love story of Krishna and Radha was a favorite subject for Kangra artists and appears many times in both single-leaf paintings and in larger series of paintings that were bound together as albums and viewed as visual narratives by the Kangra aristocracy.

The AMAM has a small but good collection of Indian miniature paintings that represent a range of different subjects and regional styles. The collection also includes a number of preparatory drawings that are especially useful for teaching students about the creative processes behind these images."

And while he produced a number of important subject paintings including landscapes and interiors in which he experimented with different Impressionist techniques, portraiture was to become Sargent's artistic and commercial triumph. Born in Italy to American expatriate parents and raised in Florence and Paris, Sargent eventually settled in London in 1886 where he immersed himself in the high society of Edwardian life. Rising quickly as one of the leading portraitists of the day, his clients were found on both sides of the Atlantic, with Americans soon outnumbering his European followers. The portrait of Gustave Natorp, a friend of the British poet Robert Browning was likely painted on one of Sargent's trips to London prior to his settling there."

Miller Jr. Fund and Friends of Art Endowment Fund,English,,"John Martin was one of the most important nineteenth-century Romantic painters working in Britain and was known for his dramatic interpretations of classical and biblical themes. The baroque drama of <I>Cadmus and the Dragon</I> evokes the Romantic fascination with distant times and cultures; in this example, the scene is from Ovid's <I>Metamorphoses</I> and is Martin's earliest-known depiction of a classical subject. It closely follows Book III, which describes how Cadmus, sent by his parents to search for his sister Europa, consulted the Oracle of Delphi and learned that his destiny was to start a great city, the future Thebes. The Oracle told Cadmus that he should build the new city on the spot where a certain cow laid down to rest. The cow was to be sacrificed in a ritual requiring water from a sacred spring, but the men Cadmus sent to fetch the water were slaughtered by a dragon, offspring of the god Ares, that guarded the spring. 
<br><br>
In style, the painting looks back to the bravura seventeenth-century landscapes of Salvator Rosa and to his contemporary Claude Lorrain's classical heroic landscapes. <I>Cadmus and the Dragon</I> was painted one year after Martin's <I>Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion</I> (now in the Saint Louis Art Museum), which introduced the artist's successful formula of a tiny but heroic figure placed in a landscape with Romantic overtones. The small but muscular Cadmus fights a dragon whose gigantic claws nearly encircle his body. Reminiscent of Henry Fuseli's nightmarish visions, <I>Cadmus and the Dragon</I> poses its two combatants in a dark, rocky landscape illuminated by a vivid shaft of light.

(99.9 × 49.1 cm),,Gift of Oliver J. and Eda H. Caldwell,Chinese,Qing Dynasty-Republican Period (1644 - 1949),"Sets of multiple bronze bells known as biānzhōng 編鐘 were among the most important types of ritual objects used in court ceremonies during the Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1046–256 BC). This rubbing records the appearance of one of a famous set of bells known as the Bells of Liáng Qí (Liáng Qí Zhong 梁其鐘), after the early Zhou official named Liáng Qí who commissioned them.<br>
<br>
In the center and lower left sections of the bell is a text in seal script, noting that the bell set was cast to commemo-rate an appointment Liáng received from the king. The text eulogizes the achievements and virtues of the Liáng family’s imperial ancestor, as well as telling of Liáng Qí’s loyalty to the current king.<br>
<br>
Due to the particular acoustic properties of the bell shape, accentuated by the raised bosses on the surface, such bells were able to make different musical tones when struck on the front or corner of the bell. At the bottom of the bell is a pair of images of luán 鸾 / 鸞, legendary creatures who were represented with a combination of dragon and bird motifs. Not only a decoration, this pair of luán also indicates the proper place to strike the bell in order to produce one of the two different tones."

(13 × 190.5 × 12.7 cm),Clear anodized rectangular tube with chartreuse anodized boxes,Fund for Contemporary Art and Special Acquisitions Fund,American,,"A leading figure of Minimal art, Donald Judd initially trained as a painter, taking night classes at the Art Students League in New York while studying art history at Columbia University during the day. In the early 1960s, he abandoned painting to create what he called ""specific objects,"" first in wood and later in a range of materials including Perspex, galvanized iron, painted steel, aluminum, and concrete. The AMAM work, fabricated to Judd's design from industrial materials, comprises an anodized rectangular tube with chartreuse anodized boxes. The simple arrangement of his artworks was created with no meaning or composition in mind; instead, Judd said, they are ""just there."" 
<br><br>
Judd was active as an art critic for <I>ARTnews, Art International, Arts Magazine</I>, and other journals during the early 1960s. His seminal 1965 article, ""Specific Objects,"" described the new kind of three-dimensional work being made by himself and other artists who came to be known as Minimalists (a term that Judd himself rejected). Although he referred in his writings to a broad group of seemingly diverse artists-Robert Morris, Jasper Johns, Yayoi Kusama, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Dan Flavin-in all of them he recognized the use of new material, ""either recent inventions or things not used before in art,"" and above all, the singleness he sought to express in his own work. 
<br><br>
Later in his career, Judd advocated for the permanent installation of his increasingly large-scale work, as well as that of his contemporaries-a group including John Chamberlain, Dan Flavin, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, and Carl Andre- in carefully chosen environments. This vision is enacted primarily in the spaces of a former army base, Fort Russell, in the remote west Texas town of Marfa. Composed of 340 acres of land, the Chinati Foundation opened to the public in 1986.

The couple made New York their permanent home in 1964 and began creating visionary environmental projects on a huge public scale in the United States, Europe, and Australia. 
<br><br>
The AMAM's large two-part drawing was made in conjunction with Christo and Jeanne-Claude's <I>Running Fence</I> (1972-76), in which a white fabric curtain eighteen feet high ran for an amazing twenty-four-and- a-half miles from the northern California town of Cotati at Highway 101 to the Pacific Ocean at Bodega Bay. Completed on September 10, 1976, the temporary project was paid for through the sale of a variety of preparatory drawings like this one, collages, scale models, and lithographs. 
<br><br>
Photographs of <I>Running Fence</I> and the drawings connected with it are poetic testaments to the artists' creative use of topography and their engagement with the sheer scale of the physical environment to create a ""ribbon of light"" through some of Northern California's most picturesque landscapes. Passages of pastel and charcoal in the AMAM drawing re-create the lyrical movement of the fence as it makes its way to the sea. Freehand drawing is combined with technical information and, at the upper left, a commercially printed topographical map showing the path of the section of fence represented in the Oberlin drawing- making this sheet both an artistic statement and an historical document. The drawing's large scale references the monumental size of the huge ""drawing"" on the landscape created by the artists, using two hundred thousand square meters of heavy woven white nylon fabric strung from a steel cable and 2,050 steel poles.

The AMAM drawing also recalls the time-consuming yet collaborative nature inherent in these inspiring projects: forty-two months of meetings and conversations with ranchers, government officials, and many others resulted in, as described by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, ""a four- hundred-and-fifty- page Environmental Impact Report and the temporary use of hills, the sky and the Ocean."" Designed to be experienced by following forty miles of public roads in Sonoma and Marin counties, <I>Running Fence</I> was disassembled fourteen days after it was completed and the materials given to the ranchers. 
<br><br>
The museum acquired the drawing in 1977, when Ruth Coates Roush (OC 1932) made a surprise gift in honor of her close friend Ellen Johnson, on the occasion of her retirement.

Frame: 45 3/8 × 33 7/8 × 2 1/8 in. (115.3 × 86 × 5.4 cm)",,"R. T. Miller Jr. Fund, and gift of the artist in honor of Ellen Johnson on the occasion of her retirement",American,,"Ellen Johnson (1910-1992), Oberlin College art librarian, professor of art, honorary curator of modern art at the AMAM, and pioneer scholar of postwar American art, sat for this portrait in spring 1976. By this time, Johnson had studied Alice Neel's work fairly extensively and was fascinated by the unconventional artist, who had a turbulent personal life. In the early 1930s, Neel was admitted to a mental hospital after a breakdown following the collapse of her marriage and death of her daughter. The powerfully expressive drawings she made at this time, and her later portraits of New York artists, family, friends, and neighbors were uniquely expressive and iconoclastic. 
<br><br>
Johnson's sitting took place in Neel's Spanish Harlem apartment in New York City over a period of several weeks that Johnson described as ""strenuous."" During one session, Johnson recalled, her legs were so numb that when she tried to stand up, her ankle crumpled beneath her, causing her to fall. Despite the long hours of patient sitting required, the finished work is fully alive with Johnson's curiosity, forthrightness, and intensity. 
<br><br>
Working quickly and without preparatory drawings, Neel sketched directly on the canvas, capturing the vitality of the sitter through her lively and deft brushwork. Johnson documented each stage of the painting in a series of slides and described the experience in her 1993 memoirs <I>Fragments Recalled at Eighty: The Art Memoirs of Ellen H. Johnson</I>: 
<br><br>
It was fascinating to watch her work, absolutely directly, no preliminary sketch. She simply loaded the brush with a thin solution of oil paint and turpentine and quickly drew the outline of the whole thing. Mostly, for the sketch she picked up blue paint, occasionally ochre. She then began building the work up more slowly, but still with positive strokes, no fumbling. 
<br><br>
Neel told Johnson that she wouldn't like the portrait ""because I'm making you look a little askew. But you <I>are</I> a little askew; you certainly aren't <I>square</I>."" The portrait's slight off-balance appearance is apparent in the turn of Johnson's body, caused perhaps by the way she crossed her legs and twisted a bit as she pushed back in the chair. Her pose was more or less set by Neel, who asked Johnson to cross her legs and move around until she found the position Neel was looking for. 
<br><br>
The incisive three-quarter-length portrait is finished with great attention to detail in the hands and in Johnson's earrings and costume. Johnson especially liked Neel's treatment of her hands, remarking that they were individual and expressive.
<br><br>
In addition to this portrait commemorating Johnson's retirement, Oberlin College and the AMAM recognized her remarkable thirty-nine-year career by naming the museum's Ellen Johnson Gallery in her honor. Funded by Johnson's Oberlin College friend Ruth Roush (OC 1934), the gallery displays the AMAM's contemporary art, serving as a reminder both of the groundbreaking contributions Johnson made to the field and of the important art that was acquired during her tenure.

(She joked that LeWitt now owed her a new table, which he did indeed produce.) LeWitt then installed glass over the rubber rings and used <i>Washer Table</i> as a proper coffee table.

<br>
In its many manifestations and contexts, <i>Washer Table</i> exemplifies the mix of humor and deep respect with which Hesse and LeWitt approached each other’s work.

His creations are evidence of his interest in Surrealism and the relationships between art and play, making and feeling, fragility and timelessness, and the familiar and the fantastical. 
<br><br>
In this work, the box's interior is lined with pages from books: Francis Bacon's <I>De Augmentis Scientiarum (The Advancement of Learning)</I>, Spanish legal writings, French astronomical charts, and parts of a German atlas showing the coast of China's Shantung peninsula. Two cutouts from a 1956 Golden Guide to stars that illustrate tide formation provide the earliest possible date for the work. On the back wall is affixed a smiling sun, taken from the lid of an ""Il Sole""-brand antipasto can, above a French chart of the phases of the moon with a further smaller, smiling sun. Inside the box is a tray of cordial glasses containing marbles-possibly meant to represent the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter (with its moons, as there are two marbles in the fifth glass), and Saturn-as well as metal rods, a circle with a chain, and a large white ball. The work is similar to numerous other boxes in which Cornell used small glasses, marbles, larger balls, and astronomical imagery. Although his works seem to always defy description, a text he wrote in 1948 for an exhibition of his work at Copley Galleries, in Beverly Hills, sheds some light on the thought processes involved in the artist's works: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Shadow boxes become poetic theatres or settings wherein are metamorphosed the element's of a childhood pastime. The fragile, shimmering globules become the shimmering but more enduring planets-a connotation of moon and tides-the association of water less subtle, as when driftwood pieces make up a proscenium to set off the dazzling white of sea foam and billowy cloud crystallized in a pipe of fancy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The box was said by Donald Droll (from whom the AMAM acquired it) to have been given by the artist to Ohio painter Fairfield Porter in appreciation for an article Porter wrote in <I>Art and Literature #8</I> (spring 1966) on Cornell's work; Cornell later stated that it was the ""only decent"" article that had been published on his work.

It shows Rivera's preference for scenes of the post-revolutionary reconstruction of Mexican life, as opposed to muralists like Orozco who often portrayed the violence, disillusionment, and suffering of the war years.

Miller Jr. Fund and Friends of Art Endowment Fund,French,,"The subject of Moses's finding by Pharaoh's daughter was often used in the seventeenth century to show many female figures in sumptuous costumes, yet still within a biblical context. Here, Antoine Coypel depicts the succeeding moment, when the princess decides to hand Moses over to a wet nurse who is, in reality, his mother. The woman's sly look and her overt offering of a breast make clear her identity, while the young figure behind her with active arms and a conspiratorial glance is Miriam, Moses's sister. 
<br><br>
The painting was displayed at the Paris Salons in 1699 and 1704; although its original owner is not known, a print after the painting was dedicated to the Cardinal d'Estrées, an early supporter of Coypel, and thus it may have been his. The work is a brilliant fusion of the two main strands of seventeenth-century French painting- <I>Poussinisme</I> and <I>Rubénisme</I>. The former, denoting works inspired by the French artist Poussin, were celebrated for their attention to drawing, line, and composition, while the latter, named for the Flemish painter Rubens, were thought to privilege color. Here, Coypel combines a rich, shimmering palette with stately figures making elegant gestures in a friezelike composition that rises to a discreet triangle mirroring the pyramid behind, combining the two approaches. The AMAM purchased the work in 1978, making it the first painting by Antoine Coypel to enter an American museum collection.

In this view of a highway in the German countryside, Klinger transcribes the landscape in mottled, monochromatic tones that leach nature of its life force and turn the sky leaden. Although similar in form and subject to the landscapes of his Impressionist contemporaries, Klinger’s rendition is utterly divergent in its embrace of the uncanny and the ominous."

He made detailed studies of flowers, trees and rocks, and devoted a large part of volume IV of his Modern Painters to a detailed discussion of the geological formation of mountains.  For him, a sound scientific understanding of natural forms was necessary in order for the artist to attain truthful representation in landscape, which for him superseded attempts at imaginative invention.  According to his theories, laws regarding beauty and harmony in nature were manifest in the smallest fragments, and were best studied as such.  To understand a mountain range, one had to study the formation of the rocks that composed it, a theory reflected in this drawing of gold and iron."

The plug made repeat appearances in Oldenburg’s work, whether as an image rendered in soft watercolors on paper, or as a sculptural object, created at different scales and out of a wide variety of materials, including vinyl, denim, wood, and metal. An electrical plug might at first glance seem less fanciful than the ice cream cones and slices of pie for which Oldenburg is best known, but funneled through his particular vision of the world, in which everyday objects are made strange, wonderful, and sometimes menacing, even an electrical accessory can be playful while also telegraphing energy, power, and danger, as when Oldenburg has depicted the plug floating in bodies of water. In this print, made almost a decade after Oldenburg installed his giant plug at Oberlin, he reimagines it, expanded in scale, multiplied, and literally “plugged” into Cass Gilbert’s 1917 building. In 1977, postmodern architect Robert Venturi had completed an actual extension of the museum consisting of a new gallery for modern and con-temporary art along with an art library and studios, making this “alternate proposal” pure fantasy."

(44.5 × 157.9 × 30.1 cm),,Gift of Annalee Newman in memory of Ruth C. Roush (OC 1934) with additional funds from the Friends of Art Endowment Fund,American,,"First House is one of a series of works from the late 1960s and early '70s in which Siah Armajani explored the properties of different building types. The Oberlin First House exists as a model. As he did with other works from this period, Armajani also built a temporary large-scale version, which remained in his Minneapolis studio for three or four months in 1970 before being dismantled.

The First House was preceded by a group of bridges starting in 1968, in which Armajani explored structural elements, relationships between interior and exterior, and the experience of space as it unfolds to the viewer. The bridges, whether in the form of models or temporary large-scale structures, were not meant to be functional: they did not span any type of expanse, and passage was hindered or prevented in various ways. The immediate antecedent of the Oberlin work was House with Base (1969; current location unknown), which served as a transition between Armajani's investigations of the conventions of bridges and those of houses. During this same period Armajani also produced a series of conceptual works for which he used a computer to calculate complex problems. According to Janet Kardon, ""Armajani's houses are not houses but functions of their properties,"" reflecting Armajani's interest in Early American houses and vernacular architecture.

The First House is made up of two spaces: an enclosed lower level, and an attic, open in front and back, with a pitched roof. The front and back walls are both at acute angles to the right side wall, which is therefore longer than the left side wall. Physical access to the interior of the lower level is blocked by the walls that enclose all four sides, but visual access is provided on the left side through cracks between the horizontal slats and on the front by three openings in the wall.(3) No doors or windows provide circulation through or between the upper and lower spaces in the traditional sense, yet the two levels are visually and conceptually unified by the parallel openings in the slats that describe the roof, in the ceiling of the lower space, and in the front wall. These openings correspond to the three beams (6 x 6 in. beams in the large-scale version) that run the length of the house, articulating the spaces and their relationship in a manner both logical and eccentric. While the beams and analogous openings give a conceptual order to the space, the lack of symmetry in the angled ascent of the beams suggests the happenstance eccentricities characteristic of vernacular building practices.

The beam that runs along the inside of the shorter side wall juts out from the front of the house; the beam in the middle juts out half as far as the first, and the third beam, which runs along the inside of the longer side wall, begins flush with the front wall: together the ends of the beams describe a second, imaginary plane at right angles to the side walls. The two beams that run along the interiors of the side walls extend to the slatted roof, whereas the middle beam runs only to the top of the lower enclosure. Because of the angled roof, the angled front and back walls, and the varied extensions of the beams in the front, each extends upward at a different angle, and each intersects the ceiling of the lower space at a different point: after five crossbeams on the left, after six in the center, and after four on the right. These varying points of intersection with the ceiling create different visual experiences of space when viewing the interior through the three openings in the front of the house.

<br><br>	
From 1963 to 1965, Lichtenstein worked on ""Girls,"" a series of paintings based on comic book images of attractive young women. The AMAM painting <I>Craig</I> represents a single frame with a pretty blonde shown with her eyes wide and mouth partially open. Lichtenstein's choice of a narrow vertical canvas emphasizes the close-up of her face. 
<br><br>
Lichtenstein's working method was documented by photographer and art editor John Coplans, whose conversations with Lichtenstein focused on the artist's use of a projector to transfer preliminary drawings to canvas, to which he applied Ben-Day dot halftones. In early paintings like <I>Craig</I>, Lichtenstein placed the dots by hand. He later used a commercial screen for the dots, which were often applied by his assistants. Lichtenstein filled in the hair and primary colors and painted the black lines last. <I>Craig</I> is executed in oil paint and Magna, a brand of synthetic permanent colors mixed with turpentine and mineral spirits that dries quickly and has a matte finish.

Smithson conceived of the Cayuga project as a ""Site/Nonsite"" installation. Configurations of rock-salt and mirrors were simultaneous placed at the Cayuga Rock Salt Company quarry (the ""Site""), and at Cornell University's Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art (the ""Nonsite""). Eight mirrors were placed on site in the mine, and another eight along the trail that led from the mine to the gallery. An additional eight mirrors were placed in the museum gallery at equal intervals against the wall, with rock salt piled between and partly on top of the mirrors. Two larger mirrors surrounded by rock salt were placed in the center of the gallery. Although the original Mirror Displacement works (Smithson's term) from the Cayuga Salt Mine Project were destroyed, several unique reconstructions-including Slant Piece-were made under the direction of the John Weber Gallery in 1976. The pieces were reconstructed from Smithson's photographs, notes, and drawings from the project, and rock salt from the Cayuga salt mine was used. In a gallery setting, Slant Piece becomes a ""nonsite"" that absorbs, reflects, and displaces its surroundings."

<br><br>
The tintype process, invented in 1856, was less expensive and quicker than earlier photographic methods and therefore was used to create images that could be distributed to a larger audience. For Lincoln’s presidential bid in 1860, hundreds of copy tintypes were made of Matthew Brady’s portrait of the candidate for campaign ribbons. The mount of this tintype suggests that it had been placed in an album."

However, it is difficult to know for certain whether someone claiming to have psychic abilities is legitimate or not. It is possible that this woman is a charlatan attempting to convince people of her special powers to obtain their assistance in return.<br>

Sheet: 3 11/16 × 1 5/8 in. (9.3 × 4.2 cm)",,Friends of Art Endowment Fund,French,,"Scholars stand divided on the question of whether Jacques Callot aimed with these images to incite compassion or to caution beholders against fraudulent beggars. Seventeenth-century writers themselves debated the difficulty of identifying a truly needy beggar from another who was simply posing. Nevertheless, Counter-Reformation Catholic writers urged charity and compassion regardless of a recipient’s perceived virtue or need. Thomas Carr (1599–1674), founder and confessor of the convent of Saint-Augustin, in Paris, remarked that it was better that ten unworthy men be helped than one truly needy one go without. He exhorted readers to perform acts of charity for the sake of the health of their soul.<br>
<br>
Callot’s series is noteworthy for the variation of poses, ragged costumes, and sorrowful expressions. Although some of the beggars could be feigning their discomfort, most do not appear to do so. Their wasted bodies and world-weary expressions communicate the sorrows of 17th-century penury."

For the show, Miss created a temporary wooden version of this work in a square hole cut into the ground on the northeast lawn of the museum. After the exhibition, the museum offered Miss the opportunity to remake the work with durable materials, rendering it her first permanent commissioned work. Constructed in the summer of 1975 under Miss’s supervision, the second version was created with steel slats protruding from tinted concrete, in its original site.<br>
<br>
Often constructed on a monumental scale, Miss’s work is always embedded thoughtfully in its environmental surroundings. Oberlin’s installation resembles a trap and is meant to be encountered—happened upon—without warning. The top edges of the concrete were beveled to allow grass to grow over them, and its flatness and grid pattern, with repeating slats forming a design that changes with light and shade, evoke the landscape of Oberlin, a town of flat terrain set on a grid. The form that Miss employed here also appears to extend indefinitely under-ground, suggesting an ancient structure or the hidden organizational systems that undergird the natural world.

He went to Paris as a youth and was for a short time his compatriot's student, probably in 1713.  Pater worked again with Watteau for a short time during the last year of the older artist's life (1721), a period Pater said later was the most profitable of his career.  With Lancret he was the most fitted of Watteau's pupils. 
<br><br>
Pater's total oeuvre - well over 600 pictures - consists almost entirely of fétes champêtres, literally ""country festivals"":  elegant figures in a landscape, often paired off in amorous couples.  Many are inspired by Watteau, and like Watteau, Pater drew upon drawings compiled in his sketchbooks fror figures; hence they reappear throughout his work in varying combinations.  Clear, pale colors and a nervous line are among his distinctive traits. 
<br><br>
In Pater's studio at his death in 1736 were left some 50 paintings, of which 27 were catalogued as ""unfinished"".  It can be assumed but not proven that the Oberlin picture is one of these.  In degree of finish it is very close to the great Pater at the National Gallery, Washington (On the Terrace, no. 1357). 
<br><br>
Frederick the great was a major collector of Pater's work, as was Richard, fourth Marquess of Hertford and his son, Sir Richard Wallace; thus there are rich holdings of Pater both in Berlin and in the Wallace Collection, London.  The Oberlin painting was sold at auction in Paris in June 1920 (as Assemblée dans un Parc) to M. Gutzwiller, Paris, where it remained at least until 1928, when the Pater catalog raisonné was published.

French writers not only praised Dutch artists for their naturalism and imitative abilities, but also identified Rembrandt in particular as a “painter of the people,” and a “painter of humanity.” This view has endured. Flameng follows Rembrandt in representing Christ surrounded by the poor and sick. A paralytic lies on a carpet at his feet; two kneeling figures petition him, dressed in costumes registering ethnic or regional distinctions; a sick figure lying on a cart is wheeled to Christ for healing. Rembrandt’s interest in a range of human types, including individuals of humble rank, sets him apart from many of his contemporary artists."

Drawing inspiration from his frequent visits to the rustic village of Barbizon, Jacque developed a large repertoire of prints dominated by scenes of animals and agrarian life. More than just an observer, Jacque was a practicing farmer and poultry breeder. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, he sought not to romanticize the land but to present his own experience of it. <i>The Storm</i> is one such interpretation. Featuring a flock of sheep (one of Jacque’s most frequent subjects), a herd of cows, a dog, and a farmer, the scene portrays a sense of camaraderie between the animals and the man, who persevere together against the storm. Despite his resistance to romanticization, Jacque’s print nonetheless possesses an overriding sentimentality for agrarian life."

The son of first-generation Czechoslovakian immigrants, Warhol grew up in Pittsburgh, and moved to New York in 1949, where he found work in graphic design and began collecting and making art. He set up his own studio and worked with a large number of assistants. His fame increased markedly throughout the 1960s and '70s, until his death in 1987 after complications from gall bladder surgery. 
<br><br>
The AMAM collection contains works in many media by the artist, including the <I>Electric Chair</I> and <I>Mao Tse Tung</I> print portfolios, an early shoe drawing, and iconic images of luminaries such as Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, and Jackie Kennedy. 
<br><br>
<I>Brillo Boxes</I> originated as part of Warhol's first sculptural project, produced with the help of assistants at his ""Factory,"" and exhibited in 1964 at the Stable Gallery in New York in the exhibition <I>The Personality of the Artist</I>. The exhibition included replicas of commonplace supermarket products, such as Del Monte peaches, Campbell's tomato juice, and Heinz ketchup, in addition to <I>Brillo Boxes</I>, the only nonfood item depicted in the show. Warhol's re-creation of the distinctive packaging, at significantly increased scale and in multiples, is part of his hallmark combination of popular culture with a mechanistic approach to making art. His use of repetitive commercial processes (such as the serially reproduced silkscreen), hard outlines, and flat areas of color evoke the mass-production of everyday items. Through his choice of subject matter and technique, and his work with a large group of assistants, he challenged the importance of the hand of the artist and the ""uniqueness"" of a work of art.

The AMAM boxes were produced in 1970, six years after this initial showing, during the fabrication of boxes for an exhibition held at the Pasadena Art Museum. Oberlin's boxes were among a group of reserve boxes that were not exhibited at that time. The AMAM collection also contains over 150 photographs by the artist-both silver gelatin prints and Polaroids-that were a gift of the The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in 2008, as part of The Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program.

As the son and grandson of acclaimed sculptors, it is perhaps not surprising that his most identifiable creations fuse movement, energy, bright colors, and sculptural forms. In 1926, after initial training in painting at the Art Students League in New York City, Calder moved to Paris and met Joan Miró. Miró's and Klee's abstract, biomorphic forms and bright colors likely inspired him, and he began to create small wood and wire animals and other figures. It was after a visit to Piet Mondrian's studio in 1930 that Calder began to create abstract constructions and kinetic mobiles, making his first air-driven mobile (as opposed to motorized power) in 1932. By the 1960s, demand for the artist's commissioned largescale mobiles and stabiles had increased and Calder devoted more of his time to overseeing their fabrication, though he also continued to create smaller-scale works throughout his life.

(27 × 35.6 cm),"Two horses rearing, one white, one brown, on a beach with classical ruins",Gift of Mrs. George Oenslager in honor of Jacob F. Alderfer,Italian,,"De Chirico, the originator of metaphysical painting, created this drawing during a period of transition in his career. Prior to the 1930s, his work paved the way for Surrealism. He explored themes such as nostalgia, enigma, and myth through disjointed spaces. After that decade, he turned to more conservative subjects, studying and copying the old masters and cultivating a neo-baroque style. This work, depicting two statue-like, rearing horses, is part of that transition. De Chirico's drawings and paintings of horses were very successful commercially, thus he drew and painted them prolifically throughout this period. Some dream-like qualities remain in this work:  expansive space, disjointed perspective and scale, and the seeming plasticity of the stone ruins."

Commonly translated as The Follies in English, this title does little to capture the mystery conveyed by the Spanish word disparate, which connotes something absurd, foolish, impossible, and irrational.<br>
<br>
In this image, a ferocious man straddles another and uses a bullfighter’s lance to brutally spear his skull. His victim cries out in anguish, but the witnesses to this unconscionable violence either look on with disinterested detachment or turn away, skulking into the shadowy ruins behind them.<br>
<br>
Produced in the wake of the French occupation of Spain and under the absolutist rule of King Ferdinand VII (reigned 1808, 1813–1833), this print might be read in relation to the violence and trauma of the war or to Ferdinand’s repressive regime. However, it is also possible to see it as a more universal critique of a willfully blind society—or, perhaps even worse, a society in which violence and cruelty are accepted with complacency and indifference.

The “Holy Face” became an exceptionally popular Catholic icon in both paintings and prints, functioning as an object of devotion and contempla-tion for the faithful. 
<br><br>
Dürer’s depictions of the <i>sudarium</i> (literally “sweat cloth”) present divergent characterizations of the revered object. Rather than show the narrative of Veronica and Christ, Dürer focused instead on the cloth with the miraculous image, held aloft by angels. In the earlier print, the angels and sudarium appear frontally in a traditional and symmetrical composition that accentuates the cloth’s status as a sacred object of worship. The later version  (1981.33) conveys the miraculous quality of the <i>sudarium</i> by depicting the angel dramatically unfurling it above a group of angels holding the instruments of Christ’s Passion. The crisply engraved lines of the more static composition in the 1513 print  (1967.50) contrast with the gestural etched lines of the 1516 version that emphasize the angel’s dynamic movement."

There, he was mentored by photochemist and photographer Hermann Vogel, and began making his own photographs. Over the next decades, Stieglitz assumed a legendary role, first in Europe and then in the United States, as a leader and spokesperson for the Photo-Secession movement to ensure that photography was recognized as a ""distinctive medium of individual expression"" and to introduce modernism to America. Stieglitz also championed the concept of the history of photography, rediscovering and exhibiting the work of photographers like David Hill and Robert Adamson and Julia Margaret Cameron. Stieglitz's nonhierarchical approach to media- he exhibited paintings and sculpture by Cézanne, Picasso, Braque, as well as photographs, in his gallery, known as ""291,"" its location on Fifth Avenue-encouraged specialists and the public to think about photography in a new way. 
<br><br>
Stieglitz produced some of his earliest work in Venice, a city that has long been a magnet for artists. <I>A Bit of Venice</I> exemplifies Stieglitz's pictorial formal concerns in its use of light and climate to blur contours and detail. The vertical format and the patterns of light capturing the watery atmosphere of the scene recall Whistler's etchings of Venetian subjects, and may even have been intended as an homage to the artist.

During the next decade, Cameron photographed a wide range of people around her home at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight. Her body of work, which includes both portraiture and narrative <I>tableaux vivants</I>, stands as one of the great achievements in the history of photography. 
<br><br>
Alice Liddell (1852-1934), Cameron's subject in this photograph, was made famous by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who in 1865 immortalized her in<I>Alice in Wonderland</I>. Cameron's portrait, titled <I>Alethea</I>-from the ancient Greek word meaning ""honesty"" or ""sincerity""-is a bust-length profile in an oval format. Alice's luxuriant hair sweeps back and then flows over her right shoulder, merging with the rich background, recalling contemporary explorations by Pre-Raphaelite painters. 
<br><br>
Cameron was criticized by many-and equally admired by others-for her soft focus and seemingly careless printing techniques. Nevertheless, the painterly quality of Cameron's photographs is an intentional component of her photographic vocabulary, suggesting the handmade qualities of a negative, with scratches or dust spots purposefully unretouched for effect. These imperfections also poignantly express a sense of motion or the momentary.

Cameron's photographs were rediscovered and popularized in the twentieth century by Alfred Stieglitz, who admired them for their pictorialist, handmade appearance.

The artist often represented animals in dramatic and unusual compositions, and was among the foremost painters of hunting scenes and dead game. This work is deceptively simple, from the last years of the artist's life when he was known for painting dead game on white or neutral backgrounds, highlighting their illusionism, harmonious colors, and carefully depicted textures. 
<br><br>
This painting was exhibited at the Paris Salon, the important exhibition by members of France's Royal Academy, the year it was painted, along with a now-lost pendant showing a jay and oriole hung by the feet. A contemporary critic wrote of the painting,

<blockquote>[t]he partridge is so fluffy and so natural, that I would have liked to pluck out its feathers, to see whether the flesh was as soft as its covering. The rabbit is soft, the fur is marvelously done, and the total effect of the work is better than anything in its genre the Italian masters have made.</blockquote>

Oudry was a professor at the French Royal Academy and works such as this would have served, in part, as examples of illusionism for his students, as well as paintings that demonstrate the relative qualities of hue and value of color and their role in perception.

On the right side, Steir added strokes of red, yellow, and blue ink to fill in the outlines of her flowers and squares. At the center, she made a large square using broad strokes of tusche ink wash, which she subsequently ruled with vertical lines. The square terminates in a fringe of dripping pigment along its bottom edge, an element that resembles her later <i>Waterfall</i> paintings. The title of this print refers to the instructions Steir received from her printer at Landfall Press, whose request to “roll me a rainbow” resulted in the artist’s addition of a color scale at the top of her image."

Furthermore, because prunus trees flower so early in the year, they have been seen as symbols of rejuvenation and vitality, while the lightness and delicacy of their blossoms has also made them into symbols of purity and feminine gracefulness. Historically, many painters enjoyed depicting prunus trees because the gnarled, twisting branches and the complex, delicate flowers tested their brush skills, while the irregular arrangements of the shapes and spaces in and around the forms challenged their compositional abilities.

A seal on the painting identifies it as the work of a Buddhist monk-painter named Setsugai. Little is known about him, though his name suggests that he may have been of Chinese or Korean extraction. Buddhist monks often traveled back and forth between China, Korea, and Japan, and their interactions facilitated the spread of cultural beliefs and practices among the three countries.

Frame: 50 × 85 × 3 3/16 in. (127 × 215.9 × 8.1 cm)",,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"This homage to the great Italian Renaissance painter Raphael falls into the late eighteenth- to early nineteenth-century tradition of paintings of meetings between -or in this case, the deaths of-famous historical figures. Pierre-Nolasque Bergeret's painting depicts Pope Leo X and Cardinal Bembo, among many other important figures, at Raphael's deathbed in Rome in 1520. Architect and painter Baldassare Peruzzi points toward Raphael's last painting, the <I>Transfiguration</I>, which hangs over his bed; engraver Marcantonio Raimondi looks toward a cup of Raphael's blood with downcast eyes; and Michelangelo in a yellow cloak and fellow artist Sebastiano del Piombo in red enter at the door on the left. While the manner is realistic, the painting does not in fact depict an actual event; Michelangelo was not in Rome at the time, and Giorgio Vasari, who is shown at lower left penning Raphael's life for his book of the lives of artists, was a mere eight years old. 
<br><br>
The painting was exhibited by Bergeret at the Paris Salon of 1806, where it was purchased by Napoleon for his wife Empress Josephine. She installed it in the Music Room of her château at Malmaison, later bequeathing it to her son, Eugène de Beauharnais, who took it with him to Munich. When he died in 1824, the painting passed to a Belgian private collector and was later bought from the Heim Gallery in London in 1982. Research at the time of purchase by then AMAM director Richard Spear and curator William Olander led to the revelation that this work is Bergeret's original-the one exhibited at the Salon and acquired by Napoleon. Another version long believed to be the original, which was purchased in 1847 by King Louis-Philippe, currently hangs at Malmaison. The 1806 catalogue description of the Salon painting and a print made after the original both conform to the AMAM work. The dimensions of this painting are slightly smaller than those of the later version at Malmaison (which is signed but not dated), and there are other noticeable differences between the two, including the pattern of the carpet, the shape of the feather fan, and the hair color of a figure in the foreground.

Only later did she disrupt that aim by including dolls in her images, usually toy women propped up in kitchens or bathrooms. The awkward dolls compounded the eerie quality of the photographs, and turned a critique of the representation of architectural space into a critique of domesticity and gender roles. Simmons situates her interrogation of suburban bliss within the realm of artifice, pointedly employing children’s playthings that are freighted with cultural expectations and used for social conditioning—much like photography itself.

The scroll on the right depicts Yue Fei (1103-1142), a famous general who became an icon of loyalty, bravery, and patriotism. Commanded by the Southern Song emperor Gaozong to resist the Jurchen army invaders from the north, Yue valiantly led his troops on a counterattack that nearly drove the foreign intruders out of China. As a reward for this action, the emperor personally bestowed upon the general a banner inscribed with the words ""the dedicated and loyal Yue Fei"".<br>
<br>
The central scroll depicts three generals and statesmen of the later Han dynasty, Liu Bei (162-233), Guan Yu (d. 219), and Zhang Fei (d. 220), who are visiting a legendary scholar, Zhuge Liang (181-234).  They are trying to persuade him to leave his seclusion and help them establish the Kingdom of Shu as successor to the Han. On their third visit Zhuge agreed to join their cause. All four men became archetypal figures of loyalty and valor, and their exploits were popularized in the historical novel, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which may have been the inspiration for the painting.<br>

The exact subject of the scroll on the left has not been firmly identified. Given the nature of the other two subjects, it seems that this triptych was painted for a member of the Japanese elite who valued the Confucian virtues embodied by the characters depicted in these scrolls.<br>

In the late 1960s, David Diao began to experiment with using tools other than brushes to paint. In a 2015 interview he recalled, “The whole phenomenon was a reaction against the exuberance of de Kooning and Franz Kline, against that expressive hand, the painterly touch, and so forth…. A way out of that was, for many of us, to come up with other means of getting the paint onto the canvas. People used rollers, others used scrapers, sponges, turkey basters. I was mostly using a six-inch squeegee, a car washer, since it gave me a two-and-a-half-foot extension.”"

In the hands of Goya, one of the most significant figures in the history in Spanish art, however, the result is something entirely different. Equal parts satire, caricature, and social commentary, the plates of <i>Los Caprichos</i> were intended as condemnation of human folly, superstitions, and cruelty. Although many of the images and their captions continue to resist coherent interpretation, their biting wit and exceptionally humbling effect have a universal appeal that continues to amuse and moralize even today. Publication of this series firmly established Goya as one of the most incisive and original artistic minds of his time.
<br><br>
Asleep at his work table, the artist—identifiable by the etching tools at his side—dreams of swarming nocturnal creatures signifying ignorance, evil, and deceit. In the original publication of this print, which was intended as the frontispiece for the series, Goya provided this explanation: “Fantasy, abandoned by reason, produces impossible monsters; united with it, she is the mother of the arts and the origin of marvels.” Although Goya intended the image to be a commentary on the follies of society, as are the rest of the plates in <i>Los Caprichos</i>, it also locates unbridled imagination, in all its terror and thrill, at the heart of the creative process."

<br>
Kruger’s work takes on new meaning when her images appear on a diverse range of media, from t-shirts, mugs, and tote bags to matchbooks and subway cards. Writ small, Kruger’s images circulate insidiously, infiltrating the realm of the everyday. When Kruger enlarges her images to the scale of a room, immersing the viewer in an oppressive environment, the work takes on totalitarian dimensions. Kruger’s objects also consciously address themselves to varying demographics: skateboards that say “Don’t be a jerk” (a play on goods produced by the streetwear brand Supreme, whose logo actually derives from Kruger’s work) target a very different audience than the one that might be interested in the 18-carat white gold charm of the coin motif from <i>Charisma</i>, which bears the phrase, “Money can buy you Love.”"

The rustic and pastoral landscape was the ideal setting in which to paint scenes from rural life. At this time, Pissarro had returned to the pointillist technique after meeting the painters Georges Seurat and Paul Signac in 1885.

The goal of his project was to capture the stark realism, however common or unpleasant, of American popular culture and its icons. His photos were published in the book <u>The Americans</u>, published in Paris in 1958 and in the United States the following year. His photographs often revealed an underlying sense of anxiety, loneliness, and mundane routine, and the book was widely criticized. However, Frank's vision resonated with younger generations of photographers, and his work became hugely influential.

(22.9 × 14.8 cm),,Gift of Parks (OC 1952) and Christie (OC 1952)  Campbell,Italian,,"An exceptional colorist and the most sensitive of draftsmen, Barocci executed only a few prints. Not surprisingly, his approach to printmaking was quite painterly. Here he creates an atmospheric representation of Saint Francis receiving the stigmata while praying in the hills above Assisi. Through a judicious application of both etching and engraving—an innovative combination at the time—Barocci translates the saint’s ecstasy into a physical haze of natural forms in the background that fade away from Francis’s more strongly delineated figure. Through masterful handling of the medium, Barocci conveys the intensity and wonder of the saint’s experience."

T. Miller Jr. Fund,Dutch,,"Cort made this engraving after Federico Zuccaro’s painting of the same subject, which was a recreation of a lost painting by the Greek master Apelles based on ancient literary sources. In this scene a judge accuses an artist of misdeeds, but the charges are based on slander from a rival. The judge’s ears have grown long and bat-like from listening to Anger (in chains), Envy (the winged creature), and Deceit (the man with serpent legs). The woman to the king’s right, holding a torch, personifies Calumny. On the right, the artist is being led away by Mercury and a personification of Truth, or some say Innocence. This allegory was widely known and appreciated by Renaissance artists and scholars, indicating their admiration for antiquity. This subject also addressed Renaissance artists’ wish to rival the accomplishments of their forebears and suggests that competition and rivalry were commonplace in the artistic community."

Charlesworth intended the photographs to cultivate a sense of empathy for her subjects, caught in the seconds, perhaps, before death, though we cannot know for certain whether the images record tragic events or stunts staged for the camera. The ambiguity inherent in these images renders these works a reflection on photography itself. Captured at a decisive moment given the seeming velocity of the body’s descent, this photograph stills the fall altogether, refusing us necessary context and rendering the inevitable crash to the ground elusive.

(15.6 × 41 cm),,Gift of Helen Hesse Charash,American,,"Drawing played a central role in the work of the abstract sculptor Eva Hesse. This and the three works in the case below represent different moments in Hesse's career, before she turned her attention to sculpture in 1964-5. The earliest drawing, at right in the case, was completed while Hesse was studying art at Cooper Union in New York. This rare figural work of a female nude in a studio was done before Hesse had developed her own abstract style; it is the work of a student, experimenting with subject matter, technique, and medium. Soon after finishing school in 1959, Hesse began producing abstract drawings based on geometric shapes. The drawing in the center of the case, done in watercolor and gouache, shows a deliberately playful rendering and placement of geometric forms. The luminous hues of this work are common in Hesse's drawings of this period. The work hanging on the wall is a collage of five pieces of paper. Many drawings from this period are marked by Hesse's experimentation in collage.        

The Allen Memorial Art Museum was the first museum to purchase a sculpture, Laocoön, by Hesse, in 1970.  In gratitude for its recognition of Hesse's work, and following the artist's untimely early death, her sister Helen Hesse Charash donated the artist's archives - including drawings, notebooks, sketchbooks, and other materials - to the Museum.

Although Levine’s copies are practically indistinguishable from the originals, she does often leave traces of the act of reproduction, typically in the form of slight distortions in color or surface quality—just enough to offer a hint to the observant student of art history. Levine, however, does not think of herself as an appropriation artist in the manner of Richard Prince or Barbara Kruger. Her rhetoric instead focuses on the notion of reproduction, as she aims to complicate the value (both monetary and art-historical) still attributed to originality and authenticity, even after the postmodern “death of the author” announced in the late 1960s. Ironically, Levine’s works have become valuable in their own right, illuminating the ways in which a hungry art market and complicit arts institutions are able to co-opt and neuter philosophical critiques leveled at their very foundations.

Stern (OC 1939),American,,"Thompson worked in a mode, through his deep interest in older European painting, that was largely antithetical to the prevailing styles of the day – pure abstraction and minimalism. A Black artist from Kentucky, he moved to New York, and later to Paris, Ibiza, and Rome, to become a “visual musician”, synthesizing different styles and forms. Indebted to Piero della Francesca, Raphael, and Poussin as well as the Fauves and German Expressionists, in his works he eliminates details, using broad swaths of color and patterns. He wrote, “I think painting should be…like theater, a presentation of something, some activity…Not only to expose the ability of the artist, but also for the viewer. To relate, like the paintings of the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.”"

During a period in which Oberlin is considering the construction of a ""Green Arts District"" to encompass and work with existing art, theater, classroom and other structures on the block that includes the Museum, Hall Auditorium and other College buildings, it is entertaining to contemplate a decidedly whimsical proposal for campus planning from over a quarter-century ago."

Antin, however, is not a photographer, but a producer of ideas. Sherman takes her own photographs and has refashioned conceptual undercurrents of performance and body art into increasingly powerful visual critiques. Raised in northern New Jersey, Sherman spent much of her early years watching television, drawing, and dressing up. She took up photography in 1975 as a student at SUNY-Buffalo and documented herself in different guises for a class assignment. 
<br><br>
From her early work as an undergraduate and after her move to New York City in 1977, Sherman continued to assume various roles as inventor, actress, director, costumer, and producer of scenarios that she photographed. Her ""film stills"" comment on a range of gender issues and were inspired by the small black-and-white glossies of actors that used to hang in movie theater lobbies. The AMAM's photograph belongs to a series of sixty-five grainy, black-and-white images that have the look and feel of the 1950s, presenting women as victims or predators- stereotypes reinforced by society and the movies. Dressed in a jewel-neck white blouse, carefully made up and coiffed, and posed next to a lamp, Sherman faces the viewer but averts her eyes, all within a tightly constrained space. ""When I'm really working there is this curiosity to see myself,"" Sherman says. ""It's one of the most pleasurable parts, to look in the mirror and sort of not recognize myself. It gets even better after you develop the film. In the photograph you see things you didn't even know you were doing.""

<I>Untitled Film Still #53</I> is one of an edition of three approximately 30-by-40-inch prints that were produced for each film still.

Just as Uccello aimed to document the chalice’s existence in a naturalistic space, Celmins, too, explores how each star, which at first may seem randomly scattered across the sky, is arranged at a specific distance from the others in the various strata of the universe. <i>Constellation-Uccello</i> also reveals the artist’s ability to manipulate the viewer’s perception of scale in a work of art.

Many of his most perceptive photographs are of people he encountered in the streets of Boston and Cambridge, where he lived. Part of the challenge for Nixon was to see how close he could get to his subjects with his camera before disrupting the spontaneity of the image, yet still maintain a unified formal structure. This group of older girls relaxing in the summer sun in the Boston Common park conveys at once the mixture of curiosity, self-consciousness, disregard, and aloofness often associated with adolescence.

Baldessari’s own work influenced the Pictures artists. <i>Man with Nails / Car / Reluctant Man</i> joins three unrelated photographs, “subvert[ing] analytic thought,” in the words of Douglas Crimp, but also prompting irrational or imaginative thinking.

Shields’s mother (who was also her manager) had sued the original photographer, Garry Gross, to reclaim rights to the image, which he shot in 1975 for the Playboy publication Sugar and Spice and subsequently reproduced. Gross eventually won, claiming that Shields had made a lucrative career as the “Lolita of her generation.” Only ten years old at the time of the photograph, Shields glistens with oil, standing seductively, in a bathtub, with heavily made-up eyes and pouty lips. Her body echoes the nude sculptures elsewhere in the frame, implying that the image fits squarely within the genre of the female nude, which indeed has a long tradition of sexualizing young girls. 

Prince anonymously exhibited this appropriated photograph —unchanged from the original except for its larger scale—at a Lower East Side gallery in 1983, where it was the sole work on display, and viewing was by invitation only. Though the image was already familiar to many visitors, the secretive and exclusive context that Prince created made it somehow even more salacious. Viewers were thereby rendered complicit in the work’s controversy and in Shields’s exploitation, and forced to confront—or at least acknowledge—their desire to encounter the image."

Arnold was drafted into service in World War II and eventually returned to China to conduct intelligence work with the U.S. military; he was discharged in 1946 and resumed his position at Oberlin, becoming a full professor and department chair.

Her stepmother Sarah took on the task of finishing the quilt, using pieces of Laura’s dresses for the star patterns within each square. The quilt maker’s signature block makes clear that Sarah intended it to be a mourning quilt commemorating her stepdaughter’s death. Inscriptions of poems, elegiac passages, and lines from scripture from Laura’s friends and family embellish the object, creating a therapeutic product of communal mourning and an intensely personal symbol of the deceased child. The inscribed bequest is a rare and poignant indication of the desire to ensure that this beloved object be handed down among the women in the family.

Soon upon her arrival, she co-founded the New York Graphic Workshop (1965–73) along with fellow émigrés José Guillermo Castillo from Venezuela and Luis Camnitzer from Uruguay. During this period, Porter began a series of experiments based on the wrinkling of paper, where her actions served to transform a blank sheet of paper or to cause it to nearly disappear. She extended these investigations to a grand scale, creating room-sized installations of wrinkled paper, as well as to more intimate endeavors.

<I>Wrinkle</I> derives from a related portfolio of ten photo-etchings produced by Porter at the Graphic Workshop in 1968.

This work, an artist’s proof of the seventh image in the series, is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the published edition, which is presented in a horizontal format.

In 1920, when Bearden was eleven, his family relocated to New York from North Carolina at the height of the Harlem Renaissance. He became immersed in the movement through his parents’ friendships with musicians, artists, and writers, including Duke Ellington and Langston Hughes. Bearden also looked to Dutch painters—Pieter Bruegel, Jan Steen, Pieter de Hooch, and others—because of their sensitive depictions of the middle and lower classes. As Bearden put it, “I am a man concerned with truth, not flattery, who shares a dual culture that is unwilling to deny the Harlem where I grew up or the Haarlem of the Dutch masters...” <i>Outchorus</i> marries these divergent influences, depicting one of the unifying tentpoles of culture in a medium intended for wide distribution. To make this print, Bearden created hand-colored underlays on Mylar, achieving washes of color by experimenting freely as one might in live jazz. A shaded, or “continuous tone” photographic print was then superimposed on top, adding a matrix of dots.

Lady Wigram (1767-1841) is shown wearing a black velvet gown, white ruff and Indian shawl with paisley decoration; an ermine robe that attests to her wealth is folded over the sofa. Her costume alludes, in part, to her husband's business interests in the East Indies, as shawls such as hers were imported from Kashmir, while the gown and ruff were fashionably ""Elizabethan"" at the time, reflecting British patriotism after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. Her affable expression and calm demeanor conform with what is known of her life; she bore her husband seventeen children (he had six already from his first wife) and she was well known as ""Lady Bountiful"" in Walthamstow, Essex, for her philanthropic activities, organizing coeducational schools and medical clinics, and founding a local library.

In both works, the artist captures the foreground buildings-one from a more classical, the other a more contemporary architectural style-but also subtly creates a view to a distant landscape.

However, they were probably used more frequently as moveable partitions indoors, where traditional Chinese and Japanese architecture provided large open spaces with relatively few permanent walls. Thus, screens of this variety, which were often created in pairs, could be used as needed to subdivide a room for greater privacy, for convenience, or for aesthetic effect. Because they were quite lightweight and portable, they were easy to rearrange, and because of their flexible hinges, they were easy to store, either folded up or flattened against the wall as decoration.

Instead, Baikan has deliberately chosen styles whose characteristics have affinities with the seasons he has depicted.

The long, ropy strokes that describe the mountains and the sharper, darker drawing of the trees not only approximate Lan Ying's style, they also effectively convey the visual contrast between bare trees and a snow-softened winter landscape. The harmony between subject and style in these images is also enhanced by the use of colors and ink washes that further contribute to the seasonal moods these landscapes are intended to evoke.

Frame: 20 3/4 × 29 1/2 × 4 in. (52.7 × 74.9 × 10.2 cm)",Reclining classical figure in foreground with receding colonnades to either side of figure. A train moves across the background from right to left.,Gift of Priscilla and Richard Hunt in memory of President and Mrs. William E. Stevenson,Italian,,"This painting contains all the elements of Giorgio de Chirico's signature style: a reclining classical figural sculpture, Ariadne, set in a deserted piazza, two loggia receding in the background, and a train crossing the canvas in the distant horizon between two fluttering pennants. Executed with a rich palette of yellows, greens, and browns and defined by bright light and shadows, De Chirico's imagery evokes nostalgia and mystery through the emptiness of seemingly urban spaces- unpopulated and dreamlike. The influence of his Greek and Italian heritage resonates in his architectural settings and their sculptural foils. 
<br><br>
Born in Greece and educated in Germany, De Chirico moved with his mother to Paris in 1911, joining De Chirico's brother, also an artist, who had adopted the name Alberto Savinio. In 1912, De Chirico began to incorporate the figure of Ariadne into his paintings of Italian squares or piazzas. Notable among these paintings are <I>Ariadne</I> (1913), now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and <I>Soothsayer's Recompense</I> (1913), in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although executed on a much larger scale than the AMAM picture, these paintings share the same elements, including a sculpture of Ariadne, a train in the distance, its motion made prominent by curls of smoke, and deep shadows that articulate space. In 1913, De Chirico's friend, the critic Guillaume Apollinaire, described De Chirico's art as ""metaphysical,"" a recognition of the enigmatic subject matter of much of the artist's work. 
<br><br>
The AMAM painting was examined by scholar and curator William Rubin, who indicated that it was either made around 1915-and thus an early, experimental work-or is perhaps a 1920s recasting of this earlier style and subject matter, on which De Chirico's reputation rests today. De Chirico is known for returning to earlier imagery later in life, often repeating favorite subjects that had personal meaning for him. The train that appears in many of his works, for example, may refer to his father, a railroad construction engineer who died in May 1905. The AMAM collection includes four other works by De Chirico: a small but powerful self-portrait painted in 1935-37, a terra-cotta of a rearing horse, and two works on paper.

Prentiss Fund",Roman,,"This small but elaborately modeled bust depicts a silenus, a jovial, heavy old man who often accompanies Bacchus in scenes of feasting and drinking. The work's wealth of detail was created by the complex lostwax method. The figure's beard cascades in magnificently rendered corkscrew curls down his chest, and a twisted wreath of ivy leaves-often associated with Bacchus- and berries sits in his hair. A goatskin is wrapped on his left side, tied with a cloven hoof that falls over his shoulder. A number of precious materials were used: the inlaid, piercing eyes are silver, with the pupil sockets deeply hollowed, while copper inlay was used for the berries, lips, and nipple.  
<br><br>
The silenus would have been used as a finial on a support (or <I>fulcrum</I>) forming the headrest or armrest of a reclining couch, used by wealthy Romans when resting or eating. It is an astonishingly well-modeled and high-quality example of Roman decorative arts, and significantly broadens the scope of the AMAM's collection of ancient bronzes. The sculpture was in the collection of the well-known antiquities collector the Countess de Béhague (1870-1939) in France in the early twentieth century.

Norfleet was a longtime instructor of social psychology and sociology at Harvard University, where she taught a popular course on “Photography as Sociological Description.” She also served as a curator at Harvard’s Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, where she developed an archive exploring the social history of the U.S. From 1975 to 1977, she traveled across the country, gathering abandoned prints and negatives from dozens of photography studios that were active from the 1930s to the 1960s. In her curatorial work, as in works such as this one of a horse farm, Norfleet presaged the turn toward the humble, everyday moments of life that have been at the center of photographic discourse since the 1990s.

The mythical figure represented is a <i>triton</i>, a merman that in this period was often shown with wings and a horse’s forelegs. The triton in the stupa decoration, probably matched with real and mythical figures on the other stair stringers, symbolized that beings from all realms of existence were welcome.<br>

Although the triton comes from Greek and Roman mythology and the figure is sculpted in a Graeco-Roman style, this work was created in South Asia during the Kushan Empire (30–375 CE) in the region known as Gandhāra (today parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan). It was a wealthy and cosmopolitan region, a crossroads for trade and travel.

Indeed, in the 1600s, Vlissingen was a principal harbor for the Dutch East India Company, an amalgamation of private trading companies that pursued the Dutch economic agenda in Asia. Later, it became a major port for the transatlantic slave trade. Between 1730 and 1800, about 500 ships operated by Dutch merchants departed from Vlissingen and nearby Middelburg, taking valuable exports to exchange for people on Africa’s western coast.

The AMAM photograph-one of three by the artist in the museum's collection- seems at first glance perhaps to be an extruded metal bar; it is in fact the artist's semen, taken with the use of a motor drive and a black background while the artist masturbated. Although his works tend to put the lie to the idea of bodily fluids as repellent and dangerous, Serrano acknowledged in 1989 that in his semen series, the works ""in the age of AIDS could and do refer to sexuality and AIDS,"" but stated that they were autoerotic, as opposed to homoerotic: ""The only possible reference to homoeroticism, I think, is that in the age of AIDS, male sexuality is thought of in homosexual terms.""

(40.4 × 45.5 × 17.8 cm),,Ruth C. Roush Contemporary Art Fund,American,,"Kiki Smith's close examination of the human body, represented in whole or in parts, captures its physical presence and incisively communicates the psychological and physiological import of the subject. Smith makes objects in a variety of media -plaster, bronze, glass, papier-mâché, textile, works on paper-and pays close attention to the relationships between the materials and the subjects they evoke. While Smith acknowledges that she is influenced by social and political issues, she has also said that it is the visual experience of what is happening around her that forms the major impetus for her work. 
<br><br>
<I>Untitled IV (Shield)</I> portrays a pregnant friend's belly-the last of a series of four plaster casts the artist made. Here, Smith applied the plaster directly onto the model, revealing the topography of her belly: the undulations of the baby's body within the womb; the hair, pores, and bumps of the mother's skin; her prominent navel; even capturing the impression of the elastic band of her underwear. Smith hand-modeled the edge of the plaster to create the ""shield""-like effect and used alginate- a dental-casting plaster-that has a slight pink tint resembling a pale flesh color. 
<br><br>
The rim is a critical element of the piece. The cast of the belly is taken directly from life, while the rim carries traces of the artist's hand (there are even finger marks visible on the reverse side of the piece). The interactive relationship between these portraits-the unborn child, the mother's belly, and the artist's hand-evoke both the personal and universal nature of pregnancy. Smith has also discussed the political aspects of <I>Shield</I>. In an unpublished interview with Oberlin student Elizabeth Otto, Smith discussed this work in terms of issues such as reproductive freedom, suggesting that it could be considered a defensive shield to protect rights that could be taken away.

The movement of daimyō with their samurai and servants was a frequent sight during Japan’s Edo period (1603–1868). Regulations required many of them to alternate a year at home in their domain with a year in the city of Edo, under the watchful eye of the ruling shōgun.<br>
<br>
In the painting, grasshoppers lead the party, followed by wasps carrying leaves. Behind them, crickets and praying mantises hold long-stemmed flowers aloft like banners. A group of grasshoppers carrying a cricket cage suggest the daimyō’s sedan chair; they are followed by a bell cricket who may represent the lord himself, mounted on a larger type of cricket. The wasps that surround him may be his personal bodyguards. The procession concludes with more wasps bearing the daimyō’s luggage, which is represented by a large wasp nest and berries on stems. Two grass-hoppers carrying long rice stalks seem to mark the end of the procession.

A ladder-like structure with text, a soapbox bearing footprints, a peep box, and a klieg light form a challenging inquiry into the West's relationship to Africa, and into the role of scientific classification in the colonization of African peoples.

Brought to England in 1810, Bartmann was displayed as a side-show attraction in London and Paris to demonstrate the alleged anatomical distortions of the black female, particularly the size and shape of her buttocks. Bartmann was subjected to the pseudoscientific investigations of European researchers, including an infamous dissection after her death at the age of twenty-five, as well as to the voyeuristic and judgmental gaze of the general public.

Created during the artist's residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1988-89, Sa Main Charmante is one of a series of works by Green that offer powerful and poetic tributes to women of African descent.

<br><br>
As a young man, Cole repaired irons for female relatives who worked as housekeepers. In 1989, the year the AMAM assemblage was made, he began to incorporate steam irons into his work, both as found objects and as mark-making tools. In <I>Proctor Silex (Evidence and Presence)</I>, Cole dissects and transforms a steam iron into a spirit mask, evokes a slave ship by incorporating an ironing board, and suspends a canvas scorched with the patterns created by the hot face of the iron. Hinting at a range of possible meanings, Cole's symbolically infused objects pay homage to the formal qualities of traditional African sculpture and the spiritual worlds they evoke. 
<br><br>
Over the next decade, Cole's steam irons became a personal iconography-even ""a personal brand,"" as he himself called them-that he explored in an ever-broader range of media and in which he even occasionally incorporated his own image. The AMAM also owns Cole's triptych <I>Man, Spirit, and Mask</I>, made in 1999, which consists of three large prints that refer to the ""scarification"" process of the artist's face and transformation of an iron into a mask. Using a Proctor Silex iron, Cole branded or ""scarified"" an image of his face through a photo-etching plate that was hand-colored and embossed. The artist's inventive and rich interweaving of metaphor nimbly addresses themes of religious ritual, domestic labor, and his own personal appropriation and creation of Africanized forms.

The brush or palette knife used to drag the paint was apparently lifted up on the left third of the canvas, creating a sponge-like effect. 

Richter was born in Dresden and studied there until his move in 1961 to West Germany. In his earlier works of the 1960s, Richter painted enlarged copies of black-and- white photographs, often in a hazy, indistinct manner. In the 1970s, he turned to more abstract works, using bright colors, and a gestural application of medium. The AMAM's collection of contemporary and Minimalist works is particularly strong in the decades of the 1960s and '70s, but the museum has made a point of continuing to collect in the contemporary arena, as evidenced by the present work, which also continues the museum's tradition of collecting twentieth-century German works, such as those in its acclaimed collection of Expressionist art, by artists such as Kirchner, Pechstein, and Schmidt-Rottluff.

Printmaking became an integral part of Smith’s artistic practice after 1980. This work, also commonly referred to as “the hair print,” represents a literal and metaphorical unfolding of the self as it reveals an image of a flattened imprint of the artist’s head in the round. This tangled network of curly strands of hair incorporates three distorted profiles of Smith’s face at the corners of the work. The subject of hair has a personal and cultural resonance with Smith. The artist’s given name is Chiara, and she was named after the saint, Clare of Assisi, who, when taking a vow of poverty, cut off her hair as part of her rejection of material wealth. Smith sees hair as intrinsically connected with the female experience. In an interview in which she discussed the role of hair in her work, Smith explained: “I think women have a thing about hair… many women make that renunciation—cutting off the hair as a form of self-mutilation. I mean, it’s a combination that is empowering, in order not to fit society… it’s about resistance, but also about creation and making more possibilities.”"

Plate (right): 20 1/8 × 16 in. (51.1 × 40.6 cm)",,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Italian,,"This panoramic engraving of Christ’s crucifixion at Golgotha was executed by the Italian painter and draughtsman Agostino Carracci.  The image is based on Tintoretto’s forty-foot long mural at the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice, whose massive dimensions Agostino translated into three engraved plates, printed on three different sheets of paper, in the present work.<br><br>
According to one biography of Agostino, the artist supposedly asked Tintoretto’s permission to reproduce his mural, after seeing the work during a trip he made to Venice between the years 1587 and 1589.  Other accounts contradict this claim, suggesting that Agostino worked on the reproduction without consulting Tintoretto.  Regardless of particulars involved in this engraving’s production, the finished product is a testament to Agostino’s accomplishment as a reproductive engraver.<br><br>
Agostino made only small changes to Tintoretto’s original composition, and included most elements from the original work: the flurry of soldiers, executioners, and mourners that surround the crucified Christ; the soldier who offers Christ a sponge dipped in vinegar; the mounted figure in the left background, who wields a lance with which he would later pierce Christ in the side; and the group of figures in the right foreground who play dice for Jesus’s clothing.<br><br>
According to the Gospel of Luke, a penitent and an impenitent thief were both crucified at Christ’s sides, where the former acknowledged Christ as the saviour, while the latter mocked him.  To the penitent thief, Chris promised a place in paradise.  Though Tintoretto and Agostino included depictions of both of these figures, they did not show either thief as mounted on a raised cross, as they did Christ.  To the left of the image, a group of soldiers are in the process of raising the penitent thief’s cross into position, while to the right, the impenitent thief is bound to a cross that still lies horizontally on the ground, as a figure digs a hole for it in the foreground.<br><br>
Viewed simultaneously, these three crucifixions allow the viewer to more fully imagine the different stages in the process of Christ’s own crucifixion.  And with the thieves’ crosses not yet raised, the figure of Christ remains one of the highest points and the focus of the composition, highlighted by the radiant light that emanates from him, offsetting the dark sky in the background.  As in Tintoretto’s mural, the taut ropes pulling up the cross of the penitent thief, the ladder on the ground, the gestures of the onlookers, and the upturned gazes of the group of mourning figures immediately below him, all direct attention towards the crucified Christ at the center of the image.<br><br>
Though Agostino retained these compositional elements of Tintoretto’s mural, his engraving style changes the work’s overall effect to some extent.  By this point in his engraving career, Agostino had developed an almost formulaic approach to making graphic reproductions of paintings.  The somewhat harsh outlines and the sharp juxtapositions of lights and darks in this engraving produce a much crisper image, compared to the atmospheric effects and subtle lines of Tintoretto’s mural.<br><br> 
Despite the differences between Agostino’s reproduction and the original, several different accounts attest to Tintoretto’s admiration of the engraving.  According to one account, Tintoretto was so impressed by Agostino’s rendition of his mural that he offered to serve as godfather to Agostino’s son.  In others, Tintoretto supposedly deemed the engraving a match or an improvement to his own work.  Whatever Tintoretto’s opinions on the engraving, Renaissance viewers who were familiar with the artist’s mural would have enjoyed comparing the original work with Agostino’s adaptation of it, to examine the similarities and differences between the two.  As did viewers of Tintoretto’s mural, viewers of this print would have used it as a visual reminder of Christ’s suffering and death on the cross.

Partitions & Time asks spectators to become active participants in the making of the work’s meaning by contemplating the relationship between the sitter and the accompanying text, which refers to American quota systems and federal policies regarding minority groups. The presence of text alongside a black-and-white photograph endows the work with a documentary character, encouraging the viewer to contemplate the identity of the subject in relation to the categorical and quantifiable terms in the margins."

The decomposed nature of the objects—which include amputated human hands and the autopsied corpse of an infant—recalls the photogravure technique the artist used to chemically carve the image into a printable plate. The compilation of such food items as octopus, grapes, and pomegranate references 17th-century Dutch still life, but with the inclusion of body parts Witkin deviates irreverently from the genre’s traditional focus on the sensuousness of ordinary objects. Does Witkin’s staged arrangement reduce human remains to the status of curiosities, or suggest profound connections between all forms of life? The work’s title, <I>Feast of Fools</I>, perhaps offers a clue. The feast of fools was a medieval Catholic ritual in which a low-ranking member of the clergy was elevated to the role of “Pope for a day” in a ceremony alternately considered reverential and blasphemous. Witkin’s work, too, captures the tension between homage and parody, between sacred and grotesque.

The Shahnameh covers the history of Persia and its people from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest in the 7th century. Its length runs to nine volumes, including over 50,000 verses.  Its literary content and vast temporal span covering many legendary and historical figures place the text among the masterpieces of world literature, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey.

(14 × 9.1 cm),,Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation Photography Fund,French,,"Artist, poet, essayist, performer, and political activist, Claude Cahun (born Lucy Schwob) produced mesmerizing photographs and complex photomontages using herself as protagonist. This self-portrait- in which she presents herself topless, hair cropped, with a scarf or shirt pulled up and back around her neck-belongs to a group of fictionalized explorations Cahun undertook in the 1920s using the medium of black-and-white photography. 
<br><br>
Born in Nantes, France, to a well-off Jewish family of intellectuals and educated at Oxford and the Sorbonne, Cahun was a lesbian who rejected social and sexual conventions. She shared many political, aesthetic, and social beliefs with the Surrealists, occasionally exhibiting her work in Surrealist venues, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition held at the New Burlington Gallery in 1936, and the Exposition Surréaliste d'Objets at the Charles Ratton Gallery in Paris the same year. Collaborating with her lifelong partner and stepsister, Suzanne Malherbe (who worked under the pseudonym Marcel Moore), Cahun combined her photomontages with some two hundred pages of her writings that explore dislocation, dreams, and the subconscious to create <I>Aveux non Avenus (Unavowed Confessions)</I> of 1930. The images and text together reflect Cahun's desire to re-create herself in various guises using familiar objects to produce unfamiliar ways of seeing. Like the Cubists before her, as well as her Surrealist colleagues, Cahun frequently incorporated words in her images to explore multiple meanings, with a recurring emphasis on ambiguity. ""Beneath this mask another mask,"" reads a handwritten inscription on one photomontage; ""I will never finish removing all these faces."" 
<br><br>
Through her work, Cahun became a storyteller, posing herself in single-person narratives. If her nineteenth-century predecessor Julia Margaret Cameron wanted to capture the ""soul"" of her sitters, Cahun wanted to capture and control her own image as a way of possessing herself. Cahun's photographs are often close-ups; in the AMAM photograph, for example, she scrutinizes her androgynous face and hairstyle and very visibly highlights her nipples. Staging scenarios-dressing up-has a venerable history in photography: some forty years later in the United States, photographers like Cindy Sherman took up with similar passion the exploration of self to comment on a complex range of gender issues. 
<br><br>
In the late 1930s, Cahun and Malherbe moved from Paris to the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel where they had spent summers as children. During World War II, the island was occupied by German forces, and both women were arrested in 1944 for distributing anti-Nazi literature. They escaped execution only thanks to the war's end, and most of Cahun's manuscripts and artworks were destroyed. The diary of a German officer stationed on Jersey describes the arrest of the two Jewish women, whose home was searched and found to have ""a quantity of pornographic material of an especially revolting nature. One woman had had her head shaved and been thus photographed in the nude from every angle. Thereafter she had worn men's clothes. Further nude photographs showed both women practicing sexual perversion, exhibitionism, and flagellation."" Cahun's exploration of herself and gender ambiguity, clearly, continued unabated until the end of her life.

Isaacs an electrical trigger that allowed up to twenty-four cameras to be set off sequentially to capture the incremental movements of animals or human figures.  Animal Locomotion, published in London in 1887, featured 781 plates of 20,000 photographs documenting Muybridge's motion experiments.  His zoopraxiscope, a device for projecting moving images, was a precursor to the motion picture."

Unlike the daguerreotype, however, Talbot's calotype could produce multiple prints from a single negative by capturing a latent image on light sensitive paper and developing it on paper coated with salts.  Calotypes appeared as if impressed into the page, taking on the paper's texture and recalling mezzotints or etchings.  Sun Pictures in Scotland featured twenty-three calotypes of sites connected with the life and writings of Scotland's beloved Romantic author Sir Walter Scott.  Loch Katrine was the setting for Scott's most popular poem, The Lady of the Lake (1810)."

On the left, a composite of the faces of female celebrities from the 1940s and 50s; on the right, the so-called beauties of the 80s and 90s. While neither depicts a single individual, one notices many striking differences between the two: the angularity of the bone structure and shape of the face, the hairstyle, makeup application, and brow shape. An underlying similarity in the two images, one implicitly normative, is their whiteness. If this goes unnoticed initially it is because the current standard of beauty has been informed by the likenesses of the very individuals from whom these images were created. Burson’s portraits reflect the normalization not only of what is considered beautiful, but also of what is considered feminine, perhaps criticizing these functions by making them apparent. These composite photographs also speak to racialized histories of image construction as well as to unbalanced standards and expectations in today’s (highly visual) society."

In 1982, she began to collaborate with two MIT engineers, Richard Carling and David Kramlich, to produce images such as this one. They developed a computer program that allowed photographs of faces to be combined pixel by pixel to make new images. In addition to making artworks, the program allowed them to age the human face, which eventually assisted the FBI in locating missing persons. Burson’s work offers an important precedent to the now-widely-acknowledged racial and gender bias in computerized image technologies such as facial recognition software.

There is a wistfulness in Tommy’s gaze, however; if he thinks of the future, it is closely bound to the past. If he hopes to be free of dependence, the poppies, now beyond their prime, seem to be a potentially cruel and ironic reference to one source of addiction. Nan Goldin’s photograph perfectly articulates the contradictions of a detox center: hopefulness, desired autonomy, determination to be clean, and a longing for past pleasures."

Miller Jr. Fund,French,,"In the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, priests used missals as their guide to the mass. The missal included both directions to the celebrant and all the necessary prayers and gospel readings. Decorated letters and sumptuous illustrations frequently accompanied the Ordinary of Mass and the most important feast days of the year. The mass culminated in the sacrament of the Eucharist, in which the priest consecrated the bread and wine, transforming them into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The consecration begins with the prayer “Te Igitur,” because this is the most important section of the book, it usually receives the most elaborate decoration.
<br><br>
The Mass also included musical elements. A priest celebrating mass alone would find these in his missal; however, if there were a clerical choir participating in the liturgy, they would use a gradual, a type of choir book that contained the necessary music and texts used in the mass.
<br><br>
The Canon of Mass in a missal contained the text used by a priest during the consecration of the Eucharistic host. Taken from a missal that belonged to a cleric in the town of Beauvais, in France, this leaf includes part of the Canon’s text, surrounded by ornate decorations and playful animal representations in the margins. Introducing the Latin words that translate as, “Remove from us, O Lord, our sins,” the historiated initial depicts a priest in prayer, looking up towards the face of Christ that hovers in the right corner. Through the priest’s gesture, and the chalice resting on the altar before him, this illumination depicts the liturgical ceremony in which it was used."

When the Japanese empire set up the puppet state of Manchukuo (1932–45) with the last emperor of the Qing, Pǔyí (1905–1967), as a figurehead, it caused a predicament among aristocrats, loyalists, and former officials of the Qing empire.

In fact, Pǔjīn’s horse is a copy of a much earlier work, Emaciated Horse, by the scholar-painter Gōng Kāi 龚开 (1222–1307).

<BR>
Imari ware (<I>imariyaki</I>  伊万里焼) is named after the port city that exported wares made at the nearby Arita kilns on Kyūshū, the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan. Kaolin clay is required for porcelain production, and northwestern Kyūshū was the source for the earliest known kaolin clay deposits in Japan. Many of Japan’s most famous porcelains were made in the area. Although Imari ware is found in a variety of types, this 19th century example follows the earliest 17th century style of decoration, which in turn followed Chinese models. The blue comes from cobalt oxide painted on the clay, covered with a transparent glaze and fired at a high temperature. The red, green, and gold colors are overglaze enamels, painted on top of the first glaze and fired at a lower temperature.

Although known for his formal society portraits, Carolus-Duran also produced many small, informal portraits of his friends and colleagues, including this one of Burty. The simple compositional format with the sitter in profile against a solid background harkens back to 15th and 16th century portraiture in the tradition of Bellini, Titian, and Holbein.

(99.1 × 33.7 cm),,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Chinese,Republican Period (1912 - 1949),"This scroll's combination of a traditional subject with a more contemporary style perfectly symbolizes Huang Binhong's place on the cusp between classical and modern Chinese painting.
<br><br>
The cluster of rustic buildings beside a river in a mountainous landscape depicted in this scroll is one of the most traditional subjects in Chinese painting, with a history stretching back almost a thousand years. Yet the style of the painting--with its roughly sketched buildings, dense layers of ink and colors, and intimations of light and shadow--is thoroughly twentieth century. At a time when many Chinese artists were experimenting with folk art forms or Western painting styles, Huang Binhong continued to work with classical Chinese subjects and media, turning them in innovative directions. He is now recognized as having played a key role in the survival and vitality of traditional Chinese painting in the modern era.
<br><br>
This painting is not dated, but the style is consistent with Huang's mature period. Its inscription, a quatrain in the upper right corner, helps place this painting within his oeuvre: As the sun sets on the clamorous river, we ride the strong current,
Mist gathers around the chilly cliffs, the mountains of Chu turn autumnal.
Turning my head back toward Haidong, distant across the waves,
I see only sand gulls sending off our boat.
<br><br>
Boarding a boat at Madangshan, Binhong Madangshan is a mountain in Jiangxi province overlooking the Yangzi River, and Huang was probably inspired to paint this image after one of his numerous trips around China in the late 1930s and '40s. Although the painting was never intended to be a realistic depiction of Madangshan, its association with a specific place is important for reinforcing the sense of Chinese tradition that imbues this painting. At a historical moment when the survival of China as a nation was in some doubt, Huang's travel-inspired paintings reconfirmed the vital power of the Chinese landscape to motivate the hearts and minds of its people.
<br><br>
Huang was not an overtly political artist, but the sense of cultural and national pride embodied by his paintings may be one reason why they continued to be celebrated even after the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

One of the founders of the influential Xīlíng Seal Art Society (Xīlíng Yìnshè 西泠印社), Wáng was known for his accomplishments as a calligrapher in bronze script and small seal script.<br>
<br>
This text was cast inside a famous bronze ritual vessel known as the Ding Vessel of the Duke of Mao (Máo Gōng Dǐng毛公鼎), now in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taiwan. It is the world’s longest known bronze inscription. Consisting mainly of the young King Xuan’s words, the inscription recounts the newly enthroned king’s urgent demand for the Duke of Mao, referred to as Father Yin in the text, to take charge and rebuild the kingdom, which had been thrown into turmoil by the mismanagement of the previous king.<br>
<br>
Considered as one of the top-ranked calligraphy works of bronze script, this inscription has been a key model for calligraphers since the vessel was first discovered in 1843.

The present work’s corpus of twisted, bound, and pierced copper tubes evokes the agony of the saint’s tortured body, pierced with numerous arrows. The metal construction’s abstract composition contrasts with photographic details of the wooden sculpture’s lifelike form. <I>St. Sebastian</I> is one of Garvens’s series of wall reliefs, which combine photography with found industrial materials. Garvens, who previously worked as a scientific illustrator, saw this juxtaposition as an opportunity to study the relationships between different media: “By comparing and contrasting three-dimensional materials and two-dimensional photographs, the medium of each expands the limitations of the other; where one leaves off the other picks up.”"

Goldsmith Foundation Photography Fund,American,,"After the Civil War, the United States government invested great resources and energy to expand into the territories of the western part of the country. Although many photographers accompanied survey expeditions sponsored by government agencies, others like Carleton Watkins also worked independently. Watkins, who was among the earliest photographers working in Yosemite in 1861, produced awe-inspiring images such as this monumental view of Yosemite Valley. Using the mammoth plate format (18 × 22 in. glass negatives), Watkins was the first photographer to produce and sell a substantial number of photographs of the American West both on the West and East Coasts. His spectacular images of California-along with those of William Henry Jackson and Timothy O'Sullivan- are said to have inspired President Lincoln in 1864 to sign legislation giving Yosemite to the state of California to be preserved for public use, leading the way to the establishment of the US national parks system.
<br><br>
Harmonious and carefully constructed, Watkins's photographs provide a classic representation of the idealistic landscape, emphasizing clarity, light, and spatial recession. In the AMAM photograph, the viewer is placed-slightly off center- at the convergence of a mountainside at the left and a diagonal rock face and pine trees on the right. Watkins's composition allows the viewer not only to absorb the scale of the foreground elements and detail, but also to comprehend the awesome scale and variety of natural features as one's eye travels down the cliffs and through the landscape by way of rivers and ravines. Light, dark, and shadow are captured just at the point when they merge to sculpt landscape surfaces. 
<br><br>
Watkins's exposures captured the wonder and emotion of the American sublime and communicated the scale of the American West to a fascinated public. The wet plate process, however, required long exposure times-sometimes as much as one hour for Watkins's mammoth plates, because he often photographed early in the morning or late in the afternoon to capitalize on the contrasting light and shadows falling over the landscape. As a result, the skies in Watkins's photographs often remained featureless, and he is known to have added clouds artificially by sandwiching glass negatives in his exposures or by hand-working the sky with pigment to simulate cloud effects.

Mount: 14 3/4 × 10 5/16 in. (37.5 × 26.2 cm)",,Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation Photography Fund,Scottish,,"In 1843, photographer Robert Adamson established a calotype studio in Edinburgh and subsequently formed an artistic partnership with the well-known Scottish painter David Octavius Hill. Hill and Adamson worked together just over four years, yet they produced some of the most memorable photographs ever made. They explored the genres of landscape, architecture, and portraiture with equal enthusiasm, although it is their portraits that are best known and celebrated in the history of photography. During their collaboration, which lasted until Adamson's death in 1848 at the age of twenty-seven, the two men produced about three thousand calotypes- a photographic technique prized for its handmade, painterly qualities. The calotype negative was exposed onto printing paper soaked in a salt solution, dried, and treated with silver nitrate to create salted paper prints, such as the Oberlin example. 
<br><br>
Hill and Adamson's portrait captures the lively personality of Mark Napier (1798- 1879), a lawyer who became deputy sheriff of Dumfriesshire. Napier was a member of Edinburgh's Calotype Club and shared in the widespread enthusiasm and fascination for this newly developed medium. At least five different images of Napier made by Hill and Adamson exist, all of which show the rich brown tones characteristic of salt prints. Photographed in the artists' studio garden at Rock House, Napier is shown seated surrounded by large folios of the plays of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, English dramatists from the early seventeenth century, and J. M. W. Turner's collection of prints, <I>Liber Studiorum</I>. The carefully posed sitter references well-established British portrait-painting traditions and captures Napier's likeness with refreshing immediacy and directness. 
<br><br>
Beginning in 1991, and over a period of about four years, funds generously provided by the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation made it possible for the museum to acquire this print and more than forty other important historic and contemporary photographs-including works by Henry Fox Talbot, Peter Henry Emerson, Carleton Watkins, Nan Goldin, Jenny Holzer, and others-greatly expanding the role that photography plays in teaching across the Oberlin curriculum.

<br><br>
Nauman has explained how <I>Studies for Holograms</I> grew out of his performance works:
<br><br>
“The idea of making faces had to do with thinking about the body as something you can manipulate. I had done some performance pieces—rigorous works dealing with standing, leaning, bending—and as they were performed, some of them seemed to carry a large emotional impact. I was very interested in that: if you perform a bunch of arbitrary operations, some people will make very strong connections with them and others won’t.”

This long-running series, titled <i>After,</i>, calls into question not only the traditional values of authorship, originality, and uniqueness, but the historical association of these qualities with male artists. Although Levine’s copies are practically indistinguishable from the originals, she does often leave traces of the act of reproduction, typically in the form of slight distortions in color or surface quality—just enough to offer a hint to the observant student of art history. Levine, however, does not think of herself as an appropriation artist in the manner of Richard Prince or Barbara Kruger. Her rhetoric instead focuses on the notion of reproduction, as she aims to complicate the value (both monetary and art-historical) still attributed to originality and authenticity, even after the postmodern “death of the author” announced in the late 1960s. Ironically, Levine’s works have become valuable in their own right, illuminating the ways in which a hungry art market and complicit arts institutions are able to co-opt and neuter philosophical critiques leveled at their very foundations."

This is the source of the Chinese idiom “paint the dragon and dot the eyes” (畫龍點睛 huà lóng diǎn jīng), which means to add the final touches to something that was already good, resulting in something perfect."

Set against dark backgrounds, these meditations on loss and grief become memento mori—reminders of the inevitability of death. Bleckner comments, “The way I chose to address [AIDS] was by making certain elements of my work act as memorials… I try to think about it in a way that documents images that are symbolic of the loss we feel—the loss of people and the loss of a certain relationship to culture.”"

Arnold,American,,"Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933) was one of the most influential artists and designers of the twentieth century. He largely bypassed a career with his father's famous jewelry firm, Tiffany & Co., and took up painting, studying with George Inness, later discovering his true love, that of colored glass. He pioneered research into the fabrication of iridescent, translucent, and colored glasses with textured surfaces, which created dramatic light effects. He was further influenced by artist John La Farge (1835-1910), who was also researching glass production in the 1870s; due to their intense competition, however, their friendship did not last. The AMAM has a magnificent watercolor and gouache by La Farge, <I>Ford at the Upper End of the Vai-Te-Piha ( Tautira River), Tahiti</I>, of 1891, which seems itself to shimmer with the translucent colors of stained glass. 
<br><br>
Thomas Edison, who had been experimenting with electricity since the 1860s, encouraged Tiffany to explore the production of electric lamps, and most of them were made between 1895 and 1920. The magnificent floor lamp with floral stained-glass shade in the AMAM collection was a fortunate acquisition-it was purchased at an auction at the American Legion Hall in Elyria, Ohio, from the estate of a local resident, for under $100.00 in 1963. 
<br><br>
Among the more than fifteen Tiffany pieces in the collection is also a delicate vase with a pineapple-shaped base (some describe similar bases as pinecone- or artichoke-shaped). The <I>favrile</I>-Tiffany's word, based on the old English usage for ""handmade""-iridescent glass is decorated in a ""pulled-feather"" design, and its soaring trumpet shape gives it a sense of lightness and delicacy. It was a gift to the AMAM from Oberlin alumnus and Emeritus Professor Paul Arnold (OC 1940) and his wife, Sally (OC 1941). Arnold, a distinguished artist, is represented by both prints and drawings in the AMAM collection. The drawings are five watercolor and gouache works depicting the interior of the Cass Gilbert building, made while he was a student during 1939-40.

Here she represents a voluptuous female form, without arms; arrows threaten to puncture her body between her breasts, at the back of her thigh and calves, at her navel, and between her legs. In several interviews, Bourgeois described the figure either as a self-portrait or a woman “under attack.” The figure, evidently unwittingly, “antagonized people,” who then shot at her, leaving her confused, anxious, fearful. This process transformed her, making her “ugly,” or “mean,” and then “self-destroying, self-mutilating, masochistic.” The arrows directed at the figure’s breasts and between her legs suggest that the essence of femininity is under attack. The antagonism, Bourgeois clarified, is “external, not internal,” though it sets in motion a self-destructive dynamic against which no easily identified protection lies at hand."

Richter was trained in socialist East Germany before he fled to West Germany in 1961. Both the photorealism and the optimism of Socialist Realist painting can still be seen in his work. The prominent horizon line and the invitation into the picture plane via detailed textures in the foreground also recall German Romantic landscapes. Inserting himself into these artistic lineages, Richter composed this seascape by copying and joining separate photographs of the sky and ocean. The divisions of realism and abstraction, East and West, that run through Richter’s life are translated into a visual division along the horizon—suggesting that historical, romantic notions of nature are only possible today as simulations or fantasies."

The great French photographer Nadar (pseudonym for Gaspard-Félix Tournachon) was an aeronautics enthusiast and built an enormous hot air balloon from which to take the first-ever aerial photographs. Photography had been around since the 1820s with the pioneering work of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre and his colleague Nicéphore Niépce, but early copperplate daguerreotypes required long exposure times and could not be reproduced. Advances in photographic techniques meant that by Nadar’s time, photographers had greater freedom in terms of when and where they worked. The medium presented greater expressive and artistic possibilities than ever before.

Patinir's influence on Met de Bles is evident in his panoramic views, and especially in the distant, fanciful craggy mountains that often appear in his works. 
<br><br>
This is the only known depiction of the conversion of Saul in the artist's work, and one of the very earliest representations of the theme in Netherlandish painting. As recounted in the books of Acts and Galatians, Saul of Tarsus carried letters that would enable him to persecute and imprison Christians he met on the road to Damascus. On the way, he was blinded by a heavenly light and tumbled from his horse while a voice asked, ""Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"" When he regained his sight, he converted to Christianity and took the name Paul, becoming the most important early Christian missionary and writer. Here, Christ himself is depicted in the blaze of celestial light, while Saul is shown in the very act of falling from his horse, the box of letters scattered on the ground and tumbling into a small stream. His attendants attempt to shield themselves from the brightness, as the procession wends its way forward in a serpentine curve. Such an integration of figures and landscape was a specialty of Met de Bles.

Roche imbues his compositions with spiritualism and evocations of the power of nature. 
<br><br>
In <I>Man in the Dark</I>, a male figure against a dark background seems to merge with nature itself, his fingers morphing into long, branch-like appendages, his skin rendered in a rough texture reminiscent of tree bark. A glowing halo suggests a religious icon, while the title implies a trying psychological or spiritual state. The apparent suffering of the man, captured in a state of petrification, contributes to Roche’s self-representation as a Jesus-like figure.
<br><br>
Roche’s painting technique contributes to the emotionalism of the composition.  He has applied multiple layers of oil paint to create a thick impasto. The inky black upper layers are partially scratched away, in a technique known as <I>grattage</I>, to reveal fiery reds and yellows underneath that cause the figure to glow as though from an inner light. Roche’s use of vibrant color and lively, textured surfaces are typical of Neo-Expressionism, as is the artist’s supposed transference of personal emotions to the work during its creation.

When triggered by energy stored in a capacitor, the gas molecules inside of the bulb vibrate quickly enough to create a bright flash that can be controlled with incredible accuracy. This revolutionary technology founded the basis for modern flash photography that is still used by artists and scientists alike.

This permitted him to freeze exceedingly fast movement and make exposures between 1/10,000 and 1/1,000,000 of a second. His astonishing photographs of everyday events earned him praise from around the world. Edgerton's work paved the way for the modern electronic flash, and also gave physicists a new means of analyzing the dynamics of fluids, air currents, and engines. Over the years he captured extraordinary images of hummingbirds hovering, athletes performing, bullets bursting objects, and blood coursing through capillaries.<br>

Coronet depicts the splash caused by a drop of milk falling from a dropper onto a thin layer of milk on a red plate. Mea-suring one-half inch in diameter, the splash is the culmina-tion of twenty-five years of work that Edgerton dedicated to achieving the nearly perfect symmetry apparent in the image. The uniform tips on the periphery of the splash provide valuable scientific information about the properties of liquids, while the shape is also reminiscent of a crown."

Rollins, who was white, formed a coalition of black and Latinx students from the school, who would come to be known as K.O.S, or Kids of Survival. Their practice, centered around a process they termed “jamming,” was a communal response to literary works largely by authors of color. During these sessions, one student at a time would read aloud while the rest of the group sketched. Eventually, this exercise would develop into a practice of drawing directly onto pages from the books they read. Malcolm X was a frequent source of inspiration, and many works, including this one, were created in response to reading his autobiography."

Here, Simone appears at the bottom left of the print. She is accompanied by eight influential African American women: Madame C. J. Walker (1867–1919), Sojourner Truth (ca. 1797–1883), Ida Wells (1862–1931), Fannie Lou Hamer (1917–1977), Harriet Tubman (ca. 1820–1913), Rosa Parks (1913–2005), Mary McLeod Bethune (1875–1955), and Ella Baker (1905–1986). These women are sewing a giant sunflower quilt, a traditional African American art form. Conspicuously separated from the group of women is the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. This print functions as a commentary on history’s celebration of white men’s achievements over those of African American women. <I>The Sunflower Quilting Bee at Arles</I> emphasizes the important contributions women made to the visual arts as they sew in the sunflower field, ironically the very subject of many of Van Gogh’s esteemed paintings."

She was determined to become an artist at an early age, and in 1931 studied in Munich with painter Hans Hofmann, later working with him in New York, and additionally assisted Mexican artist Diego Rivera with works in the 1930s. 
<br><br>
Nevelson subsequently began working with found objects, pieces of wood, and boxes, which she assembled and painted black, obscuring their origins and melding the whole into a composite influenced by Cubism and contemporary practices such as assemblage and action painting. Her first one-woman show was in 1941 at Nierendorf Gallery in New York, and from accounts at the time, she conceived of the installation as ""a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb, or an unusually well-conceived shop window,"" showing a flair for environmental as well as spatial constructions.

The AMAM's work, <I>Sky Gate IV</I>, displays the darkness, deep shadows, and profound sense both of solid construction and enigmatic mystery of many of Nevelson's works.

Following the 1929 stock market crash, Lange turned her attention from the studio to the streets, documenting the experiences of the unhoused, unemployed, and hungry, both in the urban and the rural United States, emphasizing her subjects’ dignity and resilience.<br>
<br>
Lange’s photographs of unemployed people and migrant workers, taken for the Farm Security Administration (FSA; prior to 1937, the Resettlement Administration), are among the most poignant and emblematic of the devastating effects of the Great Depression.

Emerson's approach, based on scientific principles, aimed to replicate nature exactly as the eye comprehended it.  By using a slightly out of focus lens, for example, Emerson imitated the human field of vision as he believed it existed - sharper in the center and blurred at the margins.  Accordingly, he also preferred the platinotype, or platinum print, for its delicate gray tones.  Emerson lived and worked in the marshy countryside of East Anglia, a coastal section of England, northeast of London, where the tradition of gathering reeds or grasses for thatching roofs persisted.  It was a dying way of life and one Emerson sought to capture as industrialization and the railway encroached on its existence."

He developed an interest in poetry, painting, and seal-carving in his early youth, when he also began to collect old seals and inkstones. From 1729 to 1734, he served as an assistant magistrate in Shexian, Anhui Province, before a new assignment took him to Taizhou, where he stayed until 1737, when illness caused him to lose both his government position and the use of his right hand. He then retreated into a Buddhist monastery in Yangzhou, relearning how to write and paint with his left hand. He is sometimes grouped with Lǐ Shàn, seen nearby, among the “Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou” 揚州八怪.

This album was painted in 1733 while Gāo was still in Anhui. The leaves depict a wide variety of subjects, from landscapes and garden rocks to floral studies and bamboo. They demonstrate a broad range of techniques, from refined outline and color images executed with a brush, to spontaneous, impressionistic images painted with the artist’s fingers. Many of the leaves are further enhanced by elegant calligraphic inscriptions explaining the paintings’ content and styles.

He was a free-spirited character who was interested in unconventional artistic techniques, and was closely associated with the ""Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou,"" whose bohemian, often alcohol-fueled lifestyles were legendary during the eighteenth century. One of Gao's most distinctive qualities was his ability to paint with his left hand. He developed this skill after a partial paralysis on his right side in 1737, and kept it up even after his recovery. Virtually all Chinese artists painted with their right hand, regardless of which hand was naturally dominant, so Gao's left-handed paintings stand out as a true oddity in the history of Chinese art. 
<br><br>
This image belongs to an album of twelve landscapes and nature studies that Gao painted in 1733, four years before he began painting with his left hand. According to its inscription, Gao created the painting using his fingers as well as a brush, and indeed, traces of the artist's fingerprints are evident in some of the black ink lines and dots. Finger painting was briefly in vogue among some of the eccentric Yangzhou artists and a few painters even grew long fingernails specifically to use in their art. Gao's painting depicts a scene of pine trees clinging to mountain peaks above a sea of clouds. The imagery looks as if it could have been painted from life, but it was most likely done in a studio. Actual <I>plein air</I> painting was extremely rare in China, although artists did sometimes use real places and sights as inspiration for their works.

Mister Bao in the Gao residence displayed a miraculous rock called Hànhǎiyǔ (Desert-feather). A painting [ of the rock ] is attached. [ I ] sketched out [the rock] to keep it in my memory. [ I ] humbly wrote down some text on the side:<br>
<br>
In ancient times, the world was still a chaotic mess. [ Gradually,] the infinite ocean became the sand blown by wind, and the greatest spirits gathered together. The nature of life was remarkably mysterious. [ Someone ] asked the rock to create a heaven. The rock then emitted rays of light so colorful that they resembled turbulent rain. By the old cypress tree on the ocean, an immortal elder waved to me and let me join him to the East Sea. Underneath the purple clouds accompanying the immortal, there grows the plant of the rock. Even ghosts will find the gold-made stem and the jade-made base magical. [ The immortal said to me:] “Regarding your fondness [ for rocks ], [ I ] give the rock to you as a gift. Moonlight was bizarrely beautiful. Clouds emerged in pure whiteness. This rock was by the water and someone painted it. The light from the rock prevents the clouds from moving, so [ I ] got off the boat, picked up the rock, and returned to the mountain and the sea. There is a more miraculous rock. The thousand-layered snow mountain contains the seed of magic [ that grows into the rock ]. As the rock stays in the mountain, it carries its spirit. Whenever the wind blows and the rain pours, the rock roars. I have two of the miraculous rocks, and I present one of them to you as a gift. Appreciating it without [ the influences of ] worldly affairs, [ you ] will find it especially amazing. I hope that [ the rock ] serves you well as you write, and the clouds from the mountain clear your mind.”<br>

Miller Jr. Fund",Chinese,Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644),"Li Liufang came from a wealthy family in Jiading (now part of Shanghai), with roots in Anhui province. Li earned a juren degree in 1606, but gave up his pursuit of an official career and built an estate, devoting himself to gardening, painting, and poetry. He traveled frequently, and was a companion to many of the leading literati artists and writers of his day. He is classified among the ""Nine Friends of Painting,"" a group of artists associated with Dong Qichang (1555-1636). He is also considered a forerunner of the Anhui School of painting.

This sketchy, improvisational landscape brilliantly exemplifies the creative tension between style and content that characterizes many of the best Chinese paintings from the period. Li Liufang wrote an inscription at the end of the painting:

On the fifth day before the Winter Solstice of the bingchen year [1616], I boarded a boat at Tangxi. As the cold rain turned to snow, I took a piece of gold-ground paper a friend had sent me and sketched this picture, Gazing at Snow along the Riverbank. (Translated by Charles Mason)

With this knowledge, the simple, austere brushstrokes of the trees and hills can be read as signs of winter desolation, the broad gray ink washes surrounding the landscape forms are brooding skies, and the metallic glint of the paper evokes the crisp chill of icy air."

(91.4 × 45.7 cm),,"Gift of Carol S. Brooks in honor of her father, George J. Schlenker, and R. T. Miller Jr. Fund",Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"Wang Jian’s painting includes a variety of brush techniques, ranging from long flowing strokes and short ropey lines, to soft dabs and sharp splotchy dots. It also combines “wet” and “dry” brush techniques to produce a saturated, solid appearance as well as a crumbly, weathered appearance. This variety of techniques, and the skill with which they are executed, make this painting a virtuoso example of Orthodox brushwork.<br>
<br>
This scroll also exhibits an ideal Orthodox school composition that is complex, yet well integrated. There are three distinct arrangements of landscape forms: the horizontal, tripartite division between fore-, middle, and background; the central vertical axis formed by the tree group, the rocky knoll, and the foothill of the mountains; and the diagonal grouping of the forms from the right foreground to the left background.<br>
<br>
According to Wang Jian’s inscription, this painting follows the style of a Yuan master Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322). By alluding to Zhao, Wang invites the knowledgeable viewer to look at this painting in the context of a long artistic tradition, and to compare it mentally to other works in that lineage. The inscription adds extra richness and complexity to the formal qualities of the painting, while at the same time it enforces a certain social exclusivity. By restricting a full appreciation of this painting to those who had an extensive knowledge of Chinese art history and culture, this painting exemplifies the Orthodox-school belief that their ideology should dictate the creation of the painting, as well as the viewing of it."

Miller Jr. Fund",Chinese,Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911),"The scholar-official Wang Yuanqi was part of a distinguished family of Jiangsu officials. He studied painting under his grandfather Wang Shimin (1592-1680) and developed in the tradition of landscape methods that had been defined by Yuan and Ming painters and championed by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). As a jinshi graduate in 1670, Wang Yunaqi eventually was appointed to a high position in charge of the imperial collection of painting and calligraphy by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662-1722). Although never a court painter, he dominated the court academy during the latter decades of his life. Together with Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, and Wang Hui (1632-1717), Wang Yuanqi  is considered one of the “Four Wangs” who were the anchors of the Orthodox school in the early Qing period.

Wang Yuanqi perpetuated what had been one of the main strengths of the literati tradition: the capacity for using old forms and techniques in fresh ways, taking advantage of the discoveries of predecessors and the evolution of centuries, but utilizing them for personal statements. In his inscription, Wang Yuanqi cites the Yuan master Ni Zan (1301-1374) as his inspiration for this scroll. Known for his sparely applied ink strokes, Ni Zan gives volume to his landmasses with a few light, rubbed ink strokes and elongated “pepper dots.” In this painting, Wang Yuanqi expands Ni Zan’s sparse topography by applying layer upon layer of dry, yet darker brushstrokes. Wang’s paramount concern was for the formal construction of the picture—the organization of dense or empty areas, balance or unbalance of masses, repetition of lines and shapes. He takes the Ni Zan composition as a starting point and plays upon it with complex deviations and distortions, including the irregularly tilted ground plane and the intricate off-symmetrical arrangement. With the strength of his brushwork, Wang enhances the sense of volume and underlying organic formation, thereby producing a solid and convincing landscape structure."

He was also involved in local politics. Having briefly been a student of Shanghai master Rèn Bónián 任伯年 (1840–1896), Wáng fully devoted himself to painting and calligraphy after retiring from politics in the early 1910s, when he also became a close friend and follower of Wú Chāngshuò, whose work is shown nearby.

He lived in seclusion near the West Lake in Hangzhou, where he wrote verse, practiced calligraphy, and dedicated himself to the pursuit of Daoist immortality. Many later writers and painters revered Lin as a cultural role model and images of him can be found on scroll paintings, ceramics, and lacquers from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.
<br><br>
This painting by the Ming-dynasty artist Xie Shichen includes references to virtually all of Lin's key attributes. It depicts the poet, accompanied by a servant boy, leaning on a gnarled plum tree that has just come into bloom and gazing at a reflection of the moon in the waters of West Lake. A crane stands on the lakeshore in the foreground, while the roof of Lin's hermitage can be seen in the misty background. A poem in the upper right corner refers to Lin's efforts to become an immortal. 
<br><br>
Xie Shichen was one of the leading artists in the city of Suzhou during the middle of the sixteenth century. He specialized in large paintings of figures in a landscape and was admired for his bold, blunt brushwork. Oberlin's scroll is an excellent example of Xie's work. It is exactly the sort of painting that would have been hung in the entrance hall of an affluent Suzhou household to demonstrate the owner's good taste and cultural aspirations.

In the foreground, as if overseeing this pastoral world, two gentlemen sit conversing in a grand pavilion, probably enjoying the cool breezes over the water. An atmosphere of quiet serenity covers everything like summer mist. <br><br>.

Early painters in China used righ blue and green colors to create landscapes, and the understated blues and greens here would have suggested antiquity to 18th-century viewers, something heightened by the inscription at the top. It identifies the place as the <i>Hall of Green Wilderness</i>  (録野堂 <i> Lǜyětáng</i> ). There were a few over the centuries, but the first was a famous building in the garden of general and statesman Péi Dù 裴度 (765–839), where elite gentlemen would gather for wine, poetry, and music.

<br><br>
“The Nymph of the Luo River” (<i>Luòshénfù</i> 洛神賦) was a famous romantic poem by Cáo Zhí 曹植 (192–232). It describes a star-crossed meeting between the poet and a beautiful river goddess. The image connects to Zhāng Hóng’s theme in that the poet Cáo Zhí was a prince who had noble intentions, but lacked political skills and drank heavily. 
<br><br>
The poem was illustrated by the major early painter Gù Kǎizhī (顧愷之, ca. 345–406), whose vision of the goddess as a willowy figure with fluttering robes and scarves became a standard representation. Here she floats above the river, her silk garments billowing around her.

<i>On a summer day in 1649, I was relaxing in the mountains.

In this image a group of villagers is seen returning home after finishing rites to the local earth god for an abundant harvest, a yearly festival that often involves heavy drinking. The artist creates three groupings of figures, led by a boy with a blossoming branch. The first is a pair of gentlemen, one supported by another boy. In the next group, below, a man too drunk to walk is on a low cart, dragged and pushed by two boys. The final group is the most comical, with one bare-chested man gesturing wildly, as another clings to him for balance and a third urges them forward.

This painting probably illustrates a line in a poem by the Southern Song dynasty poet Xiè Língyùn 謝靈運 (385–433), a nobleman who wrote many evocative poems about nature and his experiences on his vast family estate.

In Zhāng Hóng’s humorous take on a humble village schoolroom, a shabbily dressed teacher points to a line in a book, helping one student follow the text. Another boy reads the text aloud, kneeling on the ground as punishment for some misdeed. Next to him a smaller, pantsless boy stands ready with a stick to penalize any reading mistakes. Another boy, at the right in a blue robe, is secretly looking at another book, and has toys hidden behind books on the shelf under his desk. A woman sits just outside the schoolroom counting on her fingers, an empty basket next to her, suggesting that she has just sold her goods at the village market.

In imperial China, passing the grueling civil service examinations and receiving a position in the government bureaucracy was the surest route to wealth and status. Therefore, any family that could afford it had a son educated to prepare for the exams. This would have been a familiar scene to Zhāng Hóng’s elite scholarly clientele, its comical character enhanced by placing the figures in a lowly village setting.

There are many tales from imperial China of scholars so urgent to record their spontaneous verse that they jot it on the nearest surface, often a trunk of bamboo, a stone, or a banana leaf.

Zhāng Xù was also one of the “elegant, dissolute, chivalrous, or unusual characters” that the painter Zhāng Hóng referred to in his introduction—one of a group of Tang dynasty poets, artists, and scholars known as the “Eight Immortals of Drinking” (飲中八仙 <i>yǐnzhōng bāxīan</i>).

During his mission, Sū Wǔ and his party were imprisoned by the Xiongnu. The others capitulated, but Sū refused to surrender and was forced to live as a sheep herder for nineteen years. During that time, a turncoat Chinese general, Lǐ Líng 李陵, was sent to convince Sū to serve the Xiongnu, but he remained loyal to the Han Empire.

A number of references about Tao Qian occur particularly in the fifth of his ""Twenty Poems on Drinking Wine"". In this poem Tao describes his uneventful life: picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, his attention is caught by a glimpse of South Mountain. Hence, the references of chrysanthemum, eastern fence, as well as drinking wine all relate especially to Tao Qian and his eremitic, carefree life.

Once a flood hazard, today the phenomenon attracts groups of seasonal tourists.

Zhāng Hóng’s painting illustrates a legend about King Qián Liú 錢鏐 (852–932), who once ordered 500 of his strongest archers to shoot into the bores, stopping the waves so that dike construction could be completed. Later, the river came to be known as the Qiantang, or “Qian’s dike.”

The conditions of the European port of Livorno can provide insight into the socio-political situation of Spanish-controlled land during this time, as there existed an imperial relationship between Spain and Italy.

Although fabricated from silkscreen printed on canvas (rather than from woven thread), Cardillo’s works refer to the medium of tapestry and its strong associations with European notions of royalty and power, as such displays of wealth traditionally decorated the walls of palaces.

Vietnam in the late 15th to early 16th centuries was another high point for ceramics. China, for hundreds of years the largest supplier of ceramics, suddenly restricted exports, creating a vacuum in the international market.

An example is this charger, a term for a large decorative plate. It is not porcelain, like the Chinese underglazes, but stoneware, a ceramic fired at a lower temperature. To recreate the effect of white porcelain, the charger was covered with a white, tin-based slip, a watery slurry of clay.

Hartigan experienced firsthand the rampant sexism of the art world during the mid-20th century. In order to express her discontent with how female artists were treated, she signed her early work as “George Hartigan,” paying homage to two 19th-century female writers who used the pseudonyms Georges Sand and George Eliot. Hartigan constantly shifted between the gestural abstraction she witnessed in the art of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s and the figural representation that characterized painting of the early 20th century. This print reflects her interest in creating a sense of movement and emotion. Executed entirely in black, the sinuous strokes and daubs of ink appear to move forcefully across the surface of the paper in a frenzied fashion. Hartigan’s ability to reconcile figurative representation and abstraction made her an influential figure on later generations of artists."

The pejorative term Jim Crow originated from this song, and the performance of this lyrical piece developed as a precursor to the traveling minstrel shows of the mid-19th century. Characteristic of Kara Elizabeth Walker’s larger oeuvre, this print calls attention to the creation and legacy of racial stereotypes in contemporary society. <i>Do just so…</i> portrays a white stage performer who offers a dress to a nude African American girl.

Today, Walker is most famous for her installations composed of black cut-out silhouettes that recount the stories of slaves in the Antebellum South.

While the arrangements of the boots often recall the repetitive forms of sculpture by her contemporaries, including Sol LeWitt and Carl Andre, she uses photography to suggest a dynamic narrative surrounding the boots.

Frankenthaler initially explored printmaking at the recommendation of her artist-friends, namely Grace Hartigan.

On the surface, her work invoked the principles of Minimalism, which emphasized geometry, seriality, and the phenomenological encounter between viewer and object. Baer, however, pursued abstraction in search of spirituality, recalling earlier approaches by Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich, and also in pursuit of “esthetic experience” as a “powerful effector of choice and action.” Believing artistic practice to be political, Baer rejected representation as nostalgic, conservative, and authoritarian.<br>
<br>
In Baer’s “double bar” series, started in 1968, the black and brown bands that run along the edges of the painting are meant to provoke an optical effect known as Mach bands, which produce the illusion of darker edges or lines where two differing shades of gray meet one another. On this tiny panel, of which Baer made several in addition to much larger canvases, the Mach band effect makes the brown line, juxtaposed with black and gray, glitter like copper."

Artists often used mechanical forms of reproduction to produce works viewed as critical of both consumer culture and the elitism of the fine arts. Roy Lichtenstein was one of the foremost members of the Pop Art movement.<br>
<br>
Lichtenstein began to appropriate not only the subject matter but also the style of comic books in 1961. Crak!, adapted from a panel in a war-themed comic, captures the color and dynamic action of its source, as well as imitates the Ben-Day dots used for color and shading in commercial printing."

These marked lines appear to be the result of a grazing, mowing, or simple, a flattening of the meadow.",Ellen H. Johnson Bequest,English,,"In the late 1960s, Richard Long immersed himself in the international movement of Land Art, a conscious return to nature that celebrated a growing concern for the environment.  Long embarked on epic walks and documented his experiences through photography.  As one of the leading British proponents of Land Art, he embraced the anti-industrial and anti-commercial aspects of these ephemeral acts.<br>
<br>
Long is known for his small-scale interventions in the landscape—here, picking the heads off of clover flowers to create a pattern in a field. In stark contrast to other forms of land art, Long intends his works to be ephemeral, leaving only photographs like this one behind. He explores points of contact between humans and the landscape without leaving a permanent trace on it. In Long’s words, “Ideas can last forever…it’s just that one might not recognize them as a work of art. As you say, [the artwork] can be in an isolated and inaccessible place, and it might disappear after a short time, but I hope that’s what makes my work interesting.”"

His emphasis on environment shifted in the late 1960s as he moved toward “anti-form,” wherein “considerations of gravity become as important as those of space,” reflecting a broader position that artworks should be dictated primarily by the organic behavior of their materials.<br>
<br>
Beginning in 1967, Morris experimented with industrial felt in two formats: piles on the floor and rectangles hung from the wall. This early iteration of a rectangle is twice as high as it is wide, slit into eight equal strips. When hung from two nails, the weight and flexibility of the felt makes the front plane sag and bulge."

Morton had been working on installations using tree trunks and logs that, as she put it, defined “areas” operating between pictorial and sculptural modes. In 1975, to fulfill the public service requirement of a grant awarded by New York State, she staged a project called <i>Something in the Wind</i> at the South Street Seaport. As she described, “I flew over 100 nylon flags on a 19th-century fishing schooner... Each flag had the name of some friend or member of my family; people I feel good about or connected to. It was like identifying myself by naming all the people who surround me. […] Each flag is a present for the person it’s about. The work goes full circle. I got to think about each person as I made the flags; then I flew them together; then I gave the person that time and that object.” Ellen Johnson, to whom this flag was dedicated, traveled to see the installation in person, recounting later that “the flags were stunning flapping in the wind.”

Her hands are disproportionately large and her fingers are elongated.<br>
<br>
Neel often drew from life events for her subject matter. When her first daughter died of diphtheria before the age of one, the artist turned her attention to themes of motherhood and loss. Two years after her second daughter was born, Neel’s husband left for his native Cuba and took their child with him. The choice to represent a young girl in this print may relate to the tragedies she suffered as a mother."

His representations of ancient Roman monuments are not associated with decline or decay. Rather, Piranesi produced a prolific body of engraved images that took Roman ruins as a point of departure in a monumental artistic vision of classicizing, yet fundamentally new, creations. For Piranesi, ruins constitute an imaginative seed, the generative material of a new vision of Rome.<br>
<br>
The dense configuration of overgrown ruins in the foreground—fragments of ancient monuments representing trophies, a Roman map, portions of the architectural orders, a grand bridge, and a triumphal arch—suggests the vitality of Piranesi’s imagination. His four-volume set, Le antichità romane, which contained 250 plates, was an imaginative tour-de-force."

He eliminated from his process the intuitive gestures that defined his peers’ careers, instead challenging the viewer to focus their attention on meditative, monochromatic blocks of color, and the minute variations in tonality from one area of the canvas to the next. He believed that “pure” art was separate from everyday life. Close, sustained looking reveals differences in tonality within each work and between the two compositions."

The son of first-generation Czechoslovakian immigrants, Warhol grew up in Pittsburgh, and moved to New York in 1949, where he found work in graphic design and began collecting and making art. He set up his own studio and worked with a large number of assistants. His fame increased markedly throughout the 1960s and '70s, until his death in 1987 after complications from gall bladder surgery. 
<br><br>
The AMAM collection contains works in many media by the artist, including the <I>Electric Chair</I> and <I>Mao Tse Tung</I> print portfolios, an early shoe drawing, and iconic images of luminaries such as Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, and Jackie Kennedy. Warhol's series of portraits of Jackie was done in 1963 and 1964, immediately following John F. Kennedy's assassination. This event and its aftermath were replayed constantly on TV, and became part of the national psyche. A work that brings together death, celebrity, and the media, Jackie shows the young widow as reproduced in a newspaper photo. Photo graphs were of primary importance for Warhol's working practice; indeed, his approach to art may be said to be ""photographic,"" as he sought to reproduce images from newspapers, magazines, and other publications in his prints and paintings. 
<br><br>
<I>Jackie</I> was part of the collection of Professor Ellen Johnson. She became one of Warhol's friends in the early 1960s, and the work was a gift to her from the artist. She wrote in her memoirs of meetings with him in New York and the importance of photography in his work.

It is part of her <I>Slave Coast Series</I> (1993), in which she explored historical sites along the West African coast.

In the AMAM's triptych, Weems combines two photographs of Gorée Island, Senegal (now a UNESCO World Heritage site), with a central text panel printed in blood-red letters. In the right panel, lanterns hanging from the ceiling illuminate slick-looking stones that line the way to the ""Door of No Return"" through which slaves exited to board outbound ships-shown here as a blinding white void. Looking into Weems's photographs of narrow doorways and dark corridors, we accompany her on a moving journey of remembrance through spaces both sinister and sorrowful. She makes of the journey not a lecture, but a shared experience. The first two words of her text, ""Grabbing"" and ""Snatching,"" placed on separate lines, allude, of course, to the slaves' capture, often by surprise. However, Weems's last three lines, with their emphasis on ""you,"" insist upon the viewer's participation, demanding that we ponder, on an intensely personal level, the sudden, terrible peril of the slaves.

Miller Jr. Fund,American,,"Painter, drafter, and printmaker Elizabeth Murray was born in Chicago and studied at the Art Institute (1958-62) before moving to New York in 1967. Influenced by Cézanne and the Cubists, along with Minimalist artists, Murray reveled in exploring and reinvigorating the practice of painting. Some of Murray's most celebrated works are her shaped canvases. These can be positioned somewhere between painting and sculpture-with references to the work of Jasper Johns and Claes Oldenburg. 
<br><br>
As personal imagery was important to Murray, <I>Switchback</I> may depict a pair of shoes with pink ""laces"" threaded from one to the other-or it may show a stylized human heart, complete with blood vessels. The real subject of this work, however, is the tension generated between its richly painted, layered surface, and its wooden supports. The vivid blue and yellow hues of the two main forms repeat, switch roles, and are activated with swirling brushwork. In a general sense, titles are important in Murray's work; this particular one suggests a quick movement or sudden change of direction. Cubist artist Juan Gris's shifting viewpoints and fractured forms or painter and printmaker Philip Guston's late works with their cartoon shapes are most often referenced to describe Murray's playful treatment of abstract and representational forms that physically overwhelm the viewer. Murray herself acknowledged that she was ""raised on comics and cartoons and loved the way the images jumped off the page."" 
<br><br>
In addition to <I>Switchback</I>, a major midcareer painting, the AMAM has a very early painting by Murray, <I>No No It Just Can't</I>, dating from about 1967. A gift from Robert R. Littman in honor of Douglas Baxter (OC 1972), it was purchased by the donor in 1970 directly from the artist.

At the figure’s head, chest and abdomen are three circular diagrams descending in size, differing only in the color of the very center. The design, based on a 17th-century German Rosicrucian text, presents a vision of an ordered spiritual cosmos that permeates the individual as well as the wider universe. This glimpse of an invisible reality, based on Yokoo’s engagement with the imagery of Western Esoteric traditions, seems to parallel the Tibetan Body Mandala, with the deities of an elaborate cosmology arranged within a human figure.<br>

Yokoo’s graphic genius, however, energizes the work. Colorful imagery from Indian incense packages frames the top and bottom, and a beam of rainbow light streaks diagonally across the stars. Note the tiny flying saucer that seems to be traveling within the beam."

He first gained recognition for calligraphic prints, often using seal script for its aesthetic qualities. His seal characters might be recognizable words, or, as seen in these two prints, could be altered and stylized, suggesting inchoate meanings or empasizing the pictorial character of seal script.<br>
<br>
Maki Haku had a unique printing technique in which he carved a woodblock, leaving the characters and other parts raised, but then covered the carved-out areas with cement that he shaped. When printing, he used thick paper and pressed it onto the cemented areas, transferring the rough, irregular texture onto the print. When this method was combined with seal script characters it produced an archaic, almost primeval quality.<br>
<br>
Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Maki Haku created prints using seal script that were simply titled Poem, followed by a number indicating the year of production and where the print fell in the production sequence, in this case the fifteenth print of 1968. This allowed the meaning of the print to be ambiguous and evocative, even when the seal characters were recognizable. Here the characters seem to be invented by the artist, but suggest natural forces and, at the bottom, an animal of some kind."

The flat washes of color found in his paintings are reflected in this woodcut, as are the narrow, elongated figures and sharp, blocky lines characteristic of the Expressionists. There is an implied spiritual element found in many of Pechstein's graphic works, as the figures are bent solemnly in prayer or, perhaps, mourning. At the outbreak of war, Pechstein had been traveling in the Palau Islands, and in 1914 was taken prisoner in Japan. After his release, he was drafted to the front lines in 1916."

Palay (OC 1940),Japanese,Heisei Period (1989 - present),"The Japanese Mingei, or ""Folk Art,"" Movement was founded in the 1920s by the philosopher Yanagi Soetsu (1889-1921), who believed that the traditional handicrafts of Japan-especially ceramics, textiles, and basketry-reflected the aesthetic spirit of the common people and possessed great cultural value. Mingei adherents dedicated themselves to preserving the traditional folk arts and updating them in authentic and original ways. This bottle is an excellent example of Mingei art. The form derives from a traditional square sake flask, and while the slip inlay technique used to create the design of alternating dark and light dots is also very old, the overall aesthetic of the piece is thoroughly modern. 
<br><br>
Tatsuzo Shimaoka was among the most respected and important Japanese ceramic artists of the twentieth century. He apprenticed with the great Mingei master Hamada Shoji from 1946 to 1949, before setting up his own pottery workshop in the village of Mashiko in 1953. Shimaoka quickly gained a reputation for his original interpretations of traditional forms and decorative designs. By both traveling abroad and welcoming foreign students into his Mashiko workshop, Shimaoka was instrumental in spreading knowledge of traditional Japanese pottery techniques to North America and Europe. In 1996, the Japanese government designated him as a Living National Treasure, its highest artistic recognition. 
<br><br>
This bottle belongs to a larger collection of modern Japanese art that was donated to the AMAM in 1999 by Dr. Sanford L. Palay (OC 1940), an Oberlin alumnus and important medical researcher who taught for many years at Harvard University.

But at the time, I was in analysis and the pressures I felt prevented me from going through with it. [...] In the ’60s, I had achieved a certain notoriety as a so-called avant-garde artist, and a lot was expected of me. So you see, if I was going to do a self-portrait I had to find some avant-garde way of doing it. Well, I just couldn’t put the figure in it, because I was afraid of being called retrograde.” The robe, with what Dine saw as its humble and self-assured nature, and its ability to insinuate the presence of a person without an actual body, solved his dilemma. The image recurs across his oeuvre, often in diptychs or grids of four, underscoring its insistent reiteration.

Central to Liu’s art is an investigation of the historical treatment and status of Chinese women, whom she says suffer multiple forms of oppression. While addressing broader sociopolitical issues, her art is highly personal and based on her own experiences in both China and America.<br>
<br>
This painting depicts the artist’s mother standing as a tourist in front of a rural landscape outside of Beijing. Like so many of Liu’s paintings, it is based on a photograph that has been translated onto the canvas using a self-consciously ironic manipulation of the socialist realist style in which the artist was originally trained. The cut-out shape of the picture makes it appear that the old woman is supporting the landscape on her shoulders, a device that calls to mind Chairman Mao’s statement that “women hold up half the sky.” Yet the figure’s world-weary face, slumped shoulders, and drab clothing subvert the idealistic optimism of the slogan, suggesting the reality that most Chinese women have always led lives of hard, thankless drudgery.

(37.8 × 25.1 cm),Tsuruya Kokei,Oberlin Friends of Art Fund,Japanese,Heisei Period (1989 - present),"Kabuki is a form of traditional Japanese theater in which actors use a combination of spoken words, songs, and dances to tell stories of love, heroism, betrayal, and supernatural encounters. When Kabuki was first developed in the early seventeenth century, it was performed by mixed casts of male and female actors. However, as the Japanese government feared that mixed casts could lead to inappropriate sexual activity on stage and off, Kabuki became restricted to male actors only. To compensate for this restriction, some male Kabuki actors learned to imitate female mannerisms and became specialists in performing female roles. Known as <I>onnagata</I> or <I>oyama</I>, these female-impersonating actors often attracted large fan clubs and were the popular culture superstars of their day. <I>Onnagata</I> actors continued to be prominent figures in Japan throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and many are still highly regarded by Kabuki enthusiasts today. 
<br><br>
This print depicts Nakamura Utaemon VI (1917-2001), one of the greatest <I>onnagata</I> actors of the twentieth century. As his stage name suggests, Utaemon VI belonged to a long lineage of <I>onnagata</I> actors going back to the eighteenth century. He was brought up to specialize in female Kabuki roles from a very young age, and eventually became such an expert in traditional female dress and behavior that many women came to learn from him. The Japanese government designated Utaemon VI as a Living National Treasure in 1968 and he remained a major figure in the Kabuki world right up to the time of his death in 2001. 
<br><br>
The print was designed and produced by Tsuruya Kokei. Although Kokei is the son and grandson of artists, he never received any formal artistic training and did not begin making art until he was in his early thirties. His caricature style is heavily influenced by the enigmatic, late eighteenth-century master Toshusai Sharaku, and just like Sharaku, Kokei's images were not well received by the public when he first began creating prints in the late 1970s. But with support from several Kabuki theater troupes, Kokei eventually won recognition for his work and went on to produce perhaps the most impressive body of contemporary Kabuki actor portraits. He prints his images on extremely thin paper and typically makes fewer than seventy-five impressions of each image before he destroys the blocks. Consequently, Kokei's works are difficult to obtain, and are likely to become even rarer in the future since the artist ceased making prints in 2000.

In the AIDS series, the disease was often personified in the form of monsters or ghosts, and contemporary figures connected to the AIDS crisis were portrayed as samurai or other types seen in 18th and 19th century Japanese prints. Here, photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, a victim of the disease, battles senator Jesse Helms, in blue, who was an aggressive opponent of gay rights and AIDS research. In 1989 Helms also fought funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, in part due to its sponsorship of an exhibition featuring Mapplethorpe’s frank, homoerotic nudes.<br>
<br>
Teraoka said about the painting, “In a famous movie about Hanging Rock (a site in Australia), young girls mysteriously vanish between the rocks … I thought Hanging Rock would be a good setting for a piece about Robert Mapplethorpe, whose photography has been so controversial for government officials. They would like to make him disappear.” In the painting, Jesse Helms is seen cutting up a scroll of the artist’s photos. The flames threatening to engulf Mapplethorpe may represent intolerance, or the disease that ultimately took his life.

The majority of these images were made in the garden of Rossetti's home in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, in London.

Twenty-seven prints from this shoot are preserved in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Her remarkable eyes, thick brows, tight curly hair, and expressive hands provide the focal point of this captivating portrait.

Rossetti, Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and other artists of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood first met Jane Burden in 1857 in Oxford, where they were painting murals in the debating chamber of the newly built Union. At the time, Rossetti was engaged to artist's model Lizzie Siddal, and it was William Morris who married Jane in 1859. When Lizzie overdosed on laudanum in 1862, the widowed Rossetti looked to Jane for new inspiration. From the 1860s almost until Rossetti's death in 1882, Jane sat for drawings and sketches that became the basis for a formal portrait and various imaginative compositions.

Stylistically, they reference the Cubist works of Picasso and Braque, whom Bearden met in Paris in 1950, and the photomontages of the Berlin Dadaists whom Bearden was introduced to by his teacher, artist George Grosz, as well as African American folk collage. The subject matter, however, is all Bearden's, including references to his African American heritage and the black experience in the United States. 
<br><br>
Bearden began making his collages around 1963, cutting images from popular magazines, combining them with colored papers, and adding paint or other media to weave the compositions together. He used photostats (early photocopies) to create an overall unity within his compositions and to produce large works that in many cases-including the AMAM's <I>Conjur Woman</I>-have the scale and impact of a painting. 
<br><br>
After moving to the Antilles in 1973, Bearden's work frequently incorporated the brilliant colors of the Caribbean. The bright green of the AMAM collage, for ex ample, serves as a lush backdrop for a conjure woman-spelled ""conjur"" by Bearden-dressed in deep blue with a pink snake spiraling around her outstretched right arm. Bearden was fascinated by the conjure woman and her Caribbean counterpart, the Obeah woman-spiritual healers who were respected and feared for their traditional knowledge from Africa-and he depicted them throughout his career.

The large swathes of rubber, in various tones and gradations of black, wrap about each other to create a massive knot from which appendages billow forth, menacing and intrusive, yet with a connection to both the human and animal worlds. Chakaia Booker uses these materials, reclaimed from discarded machines, to challenge our conceptions of sculpture, beauty, and abstraction. The various shades and textures of the pieces of black rubber, the patterns of the tire treads, and the knitting together of disparate materials reflect in part the artist's African American identity, calling into question the notion of ""blackness"" and bringing to mind such traditional crafts such as weaving, basketry, and sewing, connections the artist has acknowledged.

Perhaps signally appropriate for Oberlin College, which is set in the midst of surrounding farms, this piece is one of a group of works by important African American artists to enter the collection between 1998 and 2003 under former AMAM director Sharon Patton, a specialist in African American art. Oberlin's connection to African American history is particularly strong: the College was the first to accept male and female students of all races, and was a stop on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, a legacy that continues to inform the town and college today.

Today his photographs are considered some of the best documentary images of that period.

<I>Young Toughs...Yunnan</I> is one of Liu’s best known photographs, depicting three young liumang 流氓, or street toughs, typically impoverished rural youth swept up by post-Mao China’s urban underworld.  The defiant, vaguely threatening attitude they present with their postures and expressions seems like a performance, an impression reinforced by the witnessing crowd that surrounds them, observing their interaction with the then-novel spectacle of a foreign photojournalist at work, seen in the reflection. The complex, underlying reality of the moment is both concealed by and reflected in their mirrored sunglasses.

He graduated from the Jilin Institute of Art in 1984, before moving to Beijing to study printmaking at the prestigious Central Academy of Fine Arts. During the late 1980s and early '90s, Hai began to experiment with photography, which at the time in China was used primarily for documentary purposes. His initial work remained largely documentary, but instead of simply recording the existence of things, he began to show the absence of things and the changes in things over time. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Hai has developed this basic strategy still further and is now creating very sophisticated sets of images that comment profoundly on the uncertain and unstable nature of perception, memory, and time itself. 
<br><br>
<I>Three Sisters</I> is one of Hai's early works. It belongs to a series of diptych images the artist produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, in which he re-creates photographs of people who were originally taken between the 1940s and 1970s. By composing the subjects in the same arrangements as the original photos and juxtaposing the two images, Hai sets up a poignant confrontation between past and present. In this diptych, for example, the contrast between the hopeful-looking young women in the earlier photograph and the missing figure and obvious signs of aging on the faces of the two remaining women in the later photograph, forces us to reflect on the turbulent history of modern China and the very personal toll it has taken on individuals and families. Even without knowing the specific story of these three sisters, viewers can empathize with them based on their own experiences with the passage of time. The visual premise of the work is quite simple, but the emotional impact is complex and marks it-and the larger series to which it belongs-as one of the most interesting and successful examples of Chinese photography from the 1990s.

<br>
First exposed to East Asian ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, he later traveled to Japan to visit famous ceramic artists, and then to Taiwan to see Chinese ceramics from the former imperial collection. He then began to experiment with the Honan Tenmoku glaze recipe published by studio potter Bernard Leach (1887–1979), based on Chinese and Japanese black-glaze traditions. Bezanson made this glaze a part of his repertoire. He felt that his vessels shared with his East Asian predecessors a “continuity of spirit that is felt with and by all potters.”

His works are often seen as Minimalist-for their use of geometric forms, repeating patterns, and orthogonal lines-although the use of complex textures is integral to them. 
<br><br>
Drew spoke of the use of cotton, which covers half of <I>Untitled</I>, saying that ""cotton has a memory. It has a history."" Symbolically it relates to the back-breaking labor of slaves on Southern plantations, and here finds a special resonance in its pairing with splintering wooden boxes that contain materials of everyday life, including a metal toaster and toys, some stained with rust. He has stated that ""the weight of my ancestry still continues in my work"" and attributes his use of small boxes to a visit he made in 1992 to the claustrophobia-inducing small holding-quarters for slaves being sent to America, in Dakar, Senegal. Drew intentionally ages-whether with sunlight, water, shredding, or other manipulations-many of the objects he uses. The two gridded sections here together evoke the dichotomy of North and South, of urban and rural. Of similar works, Drew said in 2000, ""The grid is my basis of sanity. Otherwise it would just be noise. I mean, these things are loud, but if you know what to listen for, they'll speak to you.""

As the name implies, the Political Pop movement uses pictorial strategies and aesthetic sensibilities developed by American Pop artists of the 1960s and '70s to create images that comment on the political, social, and economic conditions that exist within modern China. 
<br><br>
<I>Chanel</I> belongs to Wang's <I>Great Criticism</I> series, the title of which refers to the Cultural Revolution-era practice of publicly criticizing certain individuals and institutions deemed to be incompatible with or insufficiently committed to the ideals of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Here, however, the target of the criticism is the post-Mao Communist state and its attempts to combine a centrally controlled, socialist political system with a free-market, capitalist economy. By ironically juxtaposing 1960s- and '70s-style political propaganda imagery with 1980sand '90s-style consumer advertising imagery, Wang points out the inconsistencies and contradictions inherent in the political and economic ideologies of Deng Xiao ping's China. The painting's critique is deepened by the strings of numbers that cover its surface. According to the artist, these numbers are meant to recall product bar codes, and thus their presence further emphasizes the parallels between propaganda and advertising as equivalent modes of mass culture communication in modern China. The numbers also highlight the painting's status as a commodity and draw attention to the fact that even avant-garde ""protest art"" has become highly commercialized in post-Tiananmen China. 
<br><br>
The AMAM began acquiring examples of contemporary Chinese art in the late 1990s in an effort to keep its Asian collections relevant and up-to-date.

Miller Jr. Fund,American,,"Edmonia Lewis was born to an African American father and Native American mother. After her mother's death, Lewis's father, who was a servant, sent her to upstate New York to live with her aunts. Funds from her brother (who had become wealthy during the California Gold Rush), enabled Lewis to be educated first in Albany and then at Oberlin College. She was enrolled in the Oberlin Preparatory Department from 1859 to 1860, and in the Ladies Literary Course from 1860 to 1863. In 1862, however, she was accused of poisoning two white female students, and was severely beaten before her trial, at which she was acquitted.
<br><br>
Abolitionists helped Lewis move to Boston to study sculpture, and she was exhibiting her art there by 1864. One such work was a bust of the Civil War hero Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who led a regiment of Black soldiers during the war; money made from the many plaster casts commissioned of it enabled Lewis to travel to Rome, where she set up a studio. 
<br><br>
James Peck Thomas (1827-1913) was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Sally Thomas, an enslaved woman, and John Catron, a prominent white jurist. Thomas's father did nothing for him, reportedly giving him just 25 cents during his lifetime. His mother, however, ultimately bought his freedom, and he then successfully petitioned for the right to remain in the state. Thomas later moved to St. Louis and--through real estate speculation and an advantageous marriage--became one of the wealthiest African Americans in the city. In 1873, Thomas visited Europe and met Lewis in her studio, commissioning this work, the artist's only marble portrait of an African American whose location is known.

However, recent archeological work indicates that brass regalia like this example were not worn only within the Oshugbo society.

Northern Song scholar-painter Song Di is credited as the creator of the eight scenes, which were popular among the literati elite. This theme later became popular not only in China, but also in Korea and Japan. In 1745, emperor Qianlong commissioned the painter-official Dong Bangda (1699-1769) to make a copy of the handscroll Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang by Ma Yuan (act. 1189-1225), then in the imperial collection. As a court painter in the Qianlong period, Zhang Kai’s album leaf could have also been painted for the emperor.

Zhang Kai was a native of Suzhou. He served in the painting academy of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods (1736-1820), holding the post of supervisor and receiving the salary of a second rank official. His specialties are landscape and flower-and-bird paintings.

Even in China, very few studies for these posters survive, making this work particularly important to the AMAM collection.

The painting shows a female student, a proletarian worker, and a People's Liberation Army soldier. According to the background inscription, they are opposing an early 1970s anti-Cultural Revolution campaign known by its slogan ""Practice Self-Control and Restore Civility"" and waged by anti-Mao forces who wanted to end the violence and destruction of the Cultural Revolution. Although unsuccessful, this campaign was one of the turning points that eventually brought the Cultural Revolution to a close in 1976.

His early prints were done in a somber social-realist style, harsh black and white images reflecting his experience during World War II and the postwar reconstruction of Japan. In 1955-56 Kitaoka studied wood engraving at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris. After his return, his prints became much more diverse, adapting various printing techniques, modes of representation, and colors to the subject matter. In <I>Crouching Woman</I>, the figure’s posture and stark line and shading combine to create an image of despair. The stony texture of the shadows was created with high-pressure printing.

Kitaoka has said, “[I]n a consummate work, form and content are absolutely inseparable and should blend together in a perfect unity.  Though I have a clear vision of content, I always have to suffer in search of the proper technical solution for its ideal form, encompassing the plastic values, design, structure and spatial relationships.”

Roush Contemporary Art Fund,Chinese,,"Since his graduation from the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts in 1991, Zeng Fanzhi has emerged as one of China's most original painters. This painting belongs to his <I>Mask</I> series of images from the late 1990s and early 2000s that depict individual figures and groups posed artificially in front of neutral backgrounds with their faces concealed by oddly impersonal, human face masks. Initially, the mundane subject and deliberately mannered aesthetic of this painting make it seem familiar and approachable, almost like an amateur photograph of a family member or friend. However, as one becomes increasingly aware of the figure's mask, stilted pose, and distorted body parts, the image quickly takes on a more disturbing tone. 
<br><br>
One possible interpretation of this painting is to see it as a commentary on the superficiality of modern Chinese society, in which people conceal their true identities in favor of false personae that are designed to help them win public acceptance and approval. This interpretation has been suggested for the entire <I>Mask</I> series by the artist himself in several public interviews. However, some critics have read works from this series as an observation on the highly commercialized nature of the Chinese economy that encourages people to conform to ever more homogeneous cultural practices and values. Others have understood the series as a critique on the repressive political climate in modern China that does not allow genuine freedom of speech and enforces obedience to a uniform party line. Still other critics have interpreted the paintings much more universally as a commentary on such fundamental existential questions as the relationship between self and other, the nature of personal identity, and the place of the individual within broader society. All of these interpretations are valid, and the multiplicity of meanings makes the painting an excellent teaching resource for Oberlin College faculty and students.

Kyodai, wracked with guilt, later confessed, exonerating the ghostly duo.<br>

The inscriptions on the print reveal an even more interesting tale. The triptych records an 1855 kabuki theater performance of the ghost story in which the actor Ichikawa Kodanji IV (1812–1866) actually played the three roles of Kanemitsu, Matahachi and Kikuno simultaneously, through clever staging.

In the early 1980s, Shen finally received formal artistic training at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing. He left China in 1989 and emigrated to Australia, where he continues to work today. The AMAM was fortunate to acquire this important painting from early in Shen's artistic career thanks to a grant from the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation. The acquisition also included a group of seventeen charcoal, ink, and oil sketches that illustrate the artist's creative process and make the painting even more valuable as a teaching tool for Oberlin College students.

Weissman,American,,"Inspiration for <I>Tina’s House</I> came from the story of Philadelphia woman Tina Rosado and her two daughters, who lost everything in a house fire. The tabletop sculpture recreates the condition of the family’s home in the aftermath of the fire; precariously stacked piles of miniature objects fill the interior, including upturned furniture, picture frames, food and household products, Barbie dolls and other toys, and a working chandelier. Many of the items are half submerged in transparent resin at ground level, suggesting a flood. Images of butterflies and Osorio’s self-portrait decorate the removable roof of the structure, while dolls representing Tina and her children occupy the snow-covered yard, complete with a white picket fence. Amid the chaos of the interior is a figurine of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a popular religious icon in many Latin American countries. The presence of the Virgin corroborates Osorio’s intentions of helping the family to restore their faith after the tragedy, aiding them in the healing process.

<I>Tina’s House</I> was one of several works in Osorio’s <I>Home Visits</I> series, which traveled to different private residences. The series recalls the Puerto Rican tradition of the visiting saint, in which religious icons are borrowed from a church for short-term private devotion in one’s home.

She is especially celebrated for her poetry collection, <i>The Book of Repulsive Women</i>, her chronicle of lesbian life in Paris, <i>Ladies Almanack</i>, and her novel, <i>Nightwood</i>, which has become a lesbian cult classic.<br>
<br>
The photographer Berenice Abbott was closeted and never publicly acknowledged her relationships with women. Writing to a friend in 1895, she emphasized the professional stakes of this decision, “I am a photographer, not a lesbian.” Nonetheless, she left behind an impressive body of portraiture documenting a community of lesbian intellectuals 
in 1920s Paris, including Djuna Barnes, Sylvia Beach, and many others. These portraits, taken in Abbott’s Paris studio, largely between 1926 and 1929, are intimate, sometimes humorous, and above all, dignified.

This large platter may have been simply decorative, or might have been used to serve large seafood items. Today, Japan accounts for about eight percent of all the fish caught in the world, and its people consume large amounts of seafood. The motifs on this platter reinforce the close relationship between people and sea creatures in Japan. The appreciation of the animals that sacrifice themselves to sustain human lives is revealed in various age-old Japanese expressions used before and after dining, such as <i>Itadakiasu</i> (I will gratefully accept your lives) and <i>Gochisosamadeshita</i> (It was a wonderful meal; I appreciated your lives).

In the early 13th century, Persian artists used underglaze decorations but did not know the secret of porcelain which required special materials and high kiln temperatures. However, they invented a new technique, overglaze enamels, called mina’i in Persian, that allowed them to add colorful decorations to their ceramics. Stoneware, fired at a lower temperature than porcelain, was covered with a tin-based white glaze and fired. Then, glaze decorations in colored, glass-like enamels could be added on top of the white glaze.<br>
<br>  
This basin uses the overglaze technique to imitate blue underglaze. In the 19th century, during the Qajar dynasty 1789–1925), imperial patronage revived the waning ceramics industry, and the export market for ceramics grew. The Hindu subject on this vessel, the god Gaṇeśa, indicates that it was made for export to India."

In response to the first drive for African American voters in the rural south, white citizens of Fayette County devised ways to systematically suppress the Black vote. A list including 1,000 names of African American Fayette residents who registered to vote was distributed to local businesses, resulting in service being denied at local gas stations, groceries, and banks. Their insurance policies were cancelled, they lost their jobs, and they were evicted from their homes. In this photograph, Withers presents a family living in a tent city, which its residents referred to as the “Fayette County Freedom Village.” With unreliable access to food and water for nearly two years, families lived in the camp, relying upon the remarkable tenacity of their familial bonds—evident in this photograph—to sustain them in the face of extreme racial injustice.

Each box held a single photograph that Jaar took while he was in Rwanda. The image, however, was not revealed to the viewer; instead, it was described in the artist's own words. His refusal to show the photographs, keeping them hidden in their black boxes, created an environment intended to be reflective and meditative.

This work translates Neto’s interest in natural phenomena and the tactility of his materials to an intimate scale. A piece of thread is sandwiched between two sheets of construction paper, fixed together with wax. A length of each end of the thread extends beyond the paper and is attached to a small lead weight. The resulting composition may be arranged in a number of configurations, which rely on the precarious tension of the weighted strings to remain upright. Part collage and part sculpture, this work was classified by the artist as an “almost drawing.” The continuous thread reads as a pencil line, while an extra length of freely arranged string suggests a spontaneous squiggle.

The artist often represented animals in dramatic and unusual compositions.  Bears are traditional exemplars of strength and courage, and were often captured, either to be tamed and taught to dance, or for the cruel practice of 'bear-baiting' in which dogs would be made to attack them.  Seen in this light, Oudry's bear is a reflection not only of his interest in the animal itself - seen from an unusual, and intimate, vantage point - but also of the eighteenth-century interest in the relationship between man and nature."

(52.9 × 44.5 cm),,Oberlin Friends of Art Fund,French,,"Couture, a student of Paul Delaroche, had a passion for historical subject matter and contemporary political criticism.  His painting Romans of the Decadence, completed in 1847, was a thinly-veiled satire of the ruling July Monarchy (1830-48), and was perceived as forecasting the government's impending doom.  Its collapse in 1848 bore this out, and already in 1847 Couture had been asked to paint a celebration of the French Revolution.  This work, The Enrollment of the Volunteers, 1792, evoked a heroic moment in the recent past in which all classes of French society united to defend the young republic from foreign attack.  This drawing is a study for the figure of the recruitment officer seated at a desk, recording the names of the volunteers.  The painting, however, was never completed, for the counter-revolution in June 1848 and the installation of Louis-Napoléon as emperor altered the political climate to such an extent that it was no longer deemed appropriate."

His images-still and silent scenes, usually devoid of people- document the ordinary and extraordinary sights that captivated him: landscapes, architecture, and design. This milliner's shop displays hats that seem to take on a life of their own through their reflection in the mirror. Behind the hat stand, a chair implies the presence of a person, but no one is there. 
<br><br>
Although Atget never intended his photographs to be artistic commodities, the seemingly accidental effects and spatial dislocations between objects and their reflections that he produced attracted the notice of other artists, particularly that of American photographer Berenice Abbott, who met Atget in 1925. At his death two years later, Abbott obtained most of his estate, including glass negatives (some of which she later reprinted); the Museum of Modern Art later acquired much of this material. 
<br><br>
Atget's <I>Milliner's Shop</I>-along with works by Franz Roh, Maurice Tabard, Lotte Jacobi, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Albert Renger-Patzsch-were presented to the AMAM in 2005 by Peter Frumkin (OC 1984) in memory of his father, Allan. Many of these photographers were not previously represented in the collection. Ten additional albumen prints by Atget were part of an important 2009 gift by Paul Walter (OC 1957), which also included two hundred photographs by Richard Avedon, Frederick Evans, Baron Adolph de Meyer, Nadar, and Carl Van Vechten, among many others. These gifts allow the museum's photography collection to support a broad range of innovative classes in many departments, including the Cinema Studies Program.

After drying, it could be dipped in a glaze made with about six percent iron oxide to create the deep black color. After that dried, a glaze with a different iron oxide content was painted on with a thick brush, resulting in the bold, abstract brown patterns during firing.

Weissman,Chinese,,"Hung Liu was born in Changchun, China, in 1948. Her father, a former Nationalist Army officer, was imprisoned by the Chinese Communist government in 1949, leaving Hung to be raised by her mother and several aunts in Beijing. As a teenager during the Cultural Revolution, Hung was sent by the government to live and work in a rural village for several years. After returning to Beijing, she attended the Beijing Teachers College and the Central Academy of Fine Arts, where she studied Socialist Realist painting. Hung emigrated to the United States in 1984 and earned an MFA from the University of California at San Diego in 1986. She is currently a professor of art at Mills College in Oakland, California. 
<br><br>
Hung is best known for creating paintings based on photographs. Some of the photographs she uses are historical images of life in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century China; others are more recent images relating to Hung's own life since her move to the United States. Many of her paintings raise issues about the historical and contemporary status of women, children, and other traditionally underprivileged social groups. The paintings also frequently address much broader questions involving the history of colonialism, emigration, and the nature of transnational cultural identity. Hung paints in an evocative, expressionistic style, building up her images with thin layers of paint that emphasize her creative process and the differences in meaning between her works and the photographs on which they are based. 
<br><br>
<I>Yoke</I> was inspired by a historical photograph of a Tibetan criminal wearing a <I>cangue</I>, a type of heavy, wooden collar that was used as a punishment in traditional China. The dimensions and weight of the <I>cangue</I> were such that the wearer typically could not stand upright or reach around the collar to feed himself. Instead, he was forced to lie on the ground and depend on the kindness of passersby for food and drink. It was a cruel form of punishment that begs larger questions about the nature of justice and the power of governments to oppress their own people. The fact that the person in this image is a Tibetan who is being punished by the Chinese also concentrates our attention more specifically on the long and troubled history of relations between those two peoples. 
<br><br>
In addition to <I>Yoke</I>, the AMAM owns several other works by Hung that are equally complex and interesting. In 2010, the AMAM was given the large painting <I>Bird Bath</I> (2001) from Hung's series <I>Strange Fruit</I>, a gift of Driek (OC 1965) and Michael (OC 1964) Zirinsky in honor of Gertrude B.

Olney Fund,American,,"Photographer, author, filmmaker, and composer, Gordon Roger Alexander Buchanan Parks was the first African American photographer to work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and for the Office of War Information (OWI), as well as for <I>Life and Vogue</I> magazines. Parks grew up in the prairie town of Fort Scott, Kansas, the youngest of fifteen children. In 1938, he bought his first camera from a pawnshop in Seattle, and soon was making not only fashion photographs, but also images of the Chicago slums. 
<br><br>
As a photographer for <I>Life</I> from 1948 through 1972, Parks covered an enormous range-from street gangs and the Civil Rights movement to Paris fashion shoots and Holly wood film stars. Under owner Henry Luce's direction, <I>Life</I> boasted the largest staff of photographers of any magazine, and Parks's colleagues included other FSA alumni such as Margaret Bourke-White and Eugene Smith. 
<br><br>
Parks's immense talent was also expressed in his writing and in the films he made. In the 1960s, he became the first black director to work for a major Hollywood studio, coproducing, directing, and writing the screenplay for <I>The Learning Tree</I>, based on his 1963 novel. He also directed the action films <I>Shaft!</I> (1971) and <I>Shaft's Big Score!</I> (1972). 
<br><br>
Parks made the AMAM's portrait of Ben Wright in conjunction with his work for the Standard Oil Photography project, a commission he won in 1944 through his former FSA boss Roy Stryker, who was hired to improve the company's corporate image. The project provided Parks with the opportunity to travel to small towns and industrial centers throughout the United States, photographing both company executives and workers, meanwhile often capturing iconic views of the American landscape along the way. Parks's ability to establish a rapport with his sitters is evident in this striking portrait.

(24.9 × 19.2 cm),,Gift of Linda and Ken Preston,German,,"This print is one of Dürer’s most well-known engravings. Shown in the Garden of Eden from which they would later be expelled, Adam and Eve are surrounded by a plethora of wildlife and foliage imbued with symbolic meaning. In his right hand, Adam holds a branch from the Tree of Life, while Eve clasps one from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. The cat, bull, rabbit, and elk that appear amid the thicket of trees signify the four human temperaments – the choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine, and melancholic – that were thrown out of equilibrium after the Fall.
<br><br>
Though even the small details of this engraving carry symbolic importance, the focus of the composition remains on the figures of Adam and Eve, whose bodies dominate the foreground. The central place allotted to their bodies betrays Dürer's keen interest in classical proportion, which he first studied under the aegis of the Venetian painter Jacopo de' Barbari (ca. 1460/70 - before 1516). Dürer's juxtaposition of Adam and Eve’s idealized bodies with symbolic references to their eventual fall from innocence adds a compelling layer of tension to this engraving.

<br>
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616) popularized the idea of a “table of tricks” in his Novelas Ejemplares (Exemplary Novels, 1613). The Spanish writer, who, like van Ostade, was interested in everyday life, invited the reader to take a seat at the table in the square. As the locals gather at the table for entertainment, the spectators must also identify the real charlatan.<br>
<br>
In this print, two men seem to fit the bill. Is it the one on the right with his noble appearance and vials on the table? Perhaps he is a physician offering curative products. Or is it the man on the other side who exudes confidence in selling goods and entertainment with his posture? The vials on the table could be part of his game or strategy. In both cases, the table serves as the means of exchange between the charlatan and his audience. Chance and fortune always accompany him.<br>
<br>
Remember that both could be masters of disguise—one uses his appearance, the other his personality. Therefore, whichever of the two stories you believe, make sure the charlatan does not deceive you."

Through Christ’s bleeding wounds and emaciated body, this image further emphasizes his suffering and ultimate death.

Pindell sees her collages as typifying a “black aesthetic,” characterized, in her words, by a “very rich surface that empowers.” Her collages are receptive, harboring all manner of artistic and quotidian materials, from gouache, tempera, and acrylic to thread, cat hair, and glitter. Both meticulously composed and riotous, the hole-punched works walk the line between order and chaos.<br>
<br>
Though Pindell’s work delights in pure abstraction, the sources of her inspiration are as everyday in nature as her materials. In a recent interview, Pindell mused that her embrace of color, which suffuses the hole-punched works, might have been inspired by her color television. Her fascination with the dot, meanwhile, might derive in part from an experience she had in the 1950s, as she and her father drove through Kentucky: They stopped at a root beer stand where every mug bore a red circle on the bottom. As she recalled, “I asked my father, ‘What is this red circle?’ He said, ‘That’s because we’re black and we cannot use the same utensils as the whites.’ I realized that’s really the origin of my being driven to try to change the circle in my mind, trying to take the sting out of that.”

Inserting an old clock motor into a mechanical camera, Larson enabled it to produce “moving pictures,” advancing and exposing the film 1º at a time, until all 360º had been shot. Photographers have often introduced long exposure times to capture a wealth of otherwise invisible information in dim lighting. But here, time takes on a different role, producing not clarifications but fluid distortions of its human subjects. The <I>Figure in Motion</I> images therefore seem to exist halfway between static and moving image, photography and film, revelation and obscurity.

François Boucher holds an unparalleled place among eighteenth- century French artists; he excelled in painting, drawing, and printmaking, as well as tapestry and porcelain design, and was especially known for the freedom and virtuosity of his draftsmanship. The AMAM's work, executed when Boucher was at the height of his powers, bears witness to his talent in various media. It is a painting with the feel of a drawing, and was made in preparation for an etching that was to be just one of a series of prints conceived by the engraver Charles-Nicolas Cochin to depict medallions made in commemoration of important episodes in the life of the king (represented by the empty circles in the AMAM painting). With wonderful effects of light and tonal variety, the painting is at once historical, contemporary, literary, mythological, and allegorical, and depicts adults, children, female and male nudes, clothed figures, waves, and putti in an energetic zigzag composition-in short, many of the elements for which Boucher is celebrated. 
<br><br>
This is the first painting by Boucher to enter the AMAM's collection and joins other distinguished paintings by French artists from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, including Antoine Coypel, Pierre-Antoine Patel, Jean-Baptiste Pater, Jean- Baptiste-Siméon Chardin Jean-Marc Nattier, Jean-Baptiste Oudry, and Louis Lagrenée, as well as prints by Antoine Watteau and Pierre Subleyras.

For Szyszlo, Túpac Amaru represents the struggle for Peruvian independence from Spanish colonial rule. Rather than literally illustrate the moment of the Incan leader’s death, Szyszlo alludes to the tragic event through his expressive use of color. The somber black that dominates the composition and the accents of vibrant pink, red, and yellow suggest violence and death. The circular disk, a recurrent motif in Szyszlo’s art, symbolizes a sun, a reference to the self-identification of the Incas as “Children of the Sun.” As king, Túpac Amaru would have functioned as the extension of the sovereignty of the Sun-God on earth; thus the dark orb represents his death. The black disk also derives from a literary source: the 16th-century Quechua text Apu Inka Atahuallpaman, an elegy to Atahualpa, another of the final leaders of the Inca Empire, which describes “a sun that turns yellow then darkens.” The bifurcation of the painting’s circular form may again allude to violence, or to a horizon line, while the bright colors and dotted patterns relate to Andean textiles.

Guanyin can be identified as a bodhisattva by her complex garments and scarves, the jewelry and ornaments she wears, and the locks of hair that tumble down her shoulders. She is seated in the “posture of royal ease” (<I>lalitāsana</I>), with one leg pendant and the other tucked in. Often called the Lotus Holder (<I>Padmāpani</I>), here Guanyin delicately grasps a lotus stem in her left hand.

The nine dragons arise from Chinese <I>yin-yang</I> numerology: even numbers are yin and odd numbers yang. Nine was considered the highest yang number, and applied to the highest yang person, the emperor. The dragons also chase flaming pearls, understood variably to represent wisdom, the moon, or the yin essence, required to complement the dragon’s yang nature.<BR>

Cloisonné is a complex decorative technique that involves creating outlines of images with gold or silver wire. Next, the outlined spaces are filled in with vitreous enamel, a kind of glass paste that can be colored, which is then fired in a kiln, like ceramics. Large vases of this type often came in pairs, and were used to decorate palace halls, although this one may have been made for the art market.

Instead, Cupid falls in love with Psyche and, after much turmoil, they marry. Rather than show the lovely Psyche, Klinger focuses on the moment when Venus’s plan is thwarted and Cupid, with his wings outstretched, lays eyes on his future wife.

Roush Contemporary Art Fund and Art Object Sales Fund,American,,"Los Angeles artist Tim Hawkinson's diverse body of work explores machines, the body, and nature through drawings, photography, inflated latex casts, and mechanical constructions. <I>The Fin Within</I> is a cast of the space between the full length of the artist's legs, from the top of his thighs to the soles of his feet. Hawkinson pressed his knees together, creating visible negative spaces that he inscribed with a crisscross pattern like the scales of a sea creature. When seen from behind, the sculpture resembles a serpentlike tail; from the front it emphasizes a fanlike webbing of the feet. From the sides, meanwhile, the impression made by the artist's leg muscles is clearly visible. All of these various references allow Hawkinson to muse playfully on man's relationship with other species, mythological creatures, or inventions, such as flippers worn by scuba divers. The word ""fin"" in the work's title prods the viewer to further engage ideas of motion, steering, and stabilizing-all within a piece that is essentially static. As in many of Hawkinson's other works, the subject is his own body, which he seeks to transform, fictionalize, and transcend. Hawkinson's explorations resonate with fellow California artist Bruce Nauman's own examinations of his body a generation or two before Hawkinson. 
<br><br>
This self-portrait, life-size but fragmentary, evokes ancient and modern references that expand as the work is situated in different contexts. Hawkinson's interdisciplinary approach to art and meaning connects with a broad range of works in the AMAM collection, including sculptures like Kiki Smith's <I>Untitled IV (Shield)</I>, a 1990 plaster cast of a friend's pregnant belly. Equally intriguing are <I>Fin'</I>s resonances with works like Rubens's <I>The Finding of Erichthonius</I> (1632-33), whose mythical subject is the snake-legged infant son of Vulcan and Gaea.

The dramatic lighting and brilliant costume seen here evoke the gas-lit stages and demi-monde glamour of café-concerts and other Parisian entertainment venues at the turn of the twentieth century. As a young artist in Prague and Vienna, Kupka was influenced by the religious art of the German Romantic painters known as the Nazarenes. Later, his interest in Symbolism led him to experiment with color theory and abstraction in painting, a style he maintained for the rest of his career.

This pastel is part of an important donation by Oberlin College alumnus Frederic Pryor and his wife, Zora, of fifty-three paintings, drawings, and prints by the artist, with subjects as varied as figural, historical, and genre scenes, landscapes, studies of the female form, portraits, and abstract works, covering almost Kupka's entire career. The Pryors also donated over 130 books and publications, both by and about Kupka, including books illustrated by the artist, magazines with his drawings, and over twenty-five exhibition catalogues of Kupka's works to the Oberlin College library. Such a variety of materials regarding the artist makes Oberlin an important center of research on Kupka and early twentieth-century Czech art.

It was during this period that he started making mezzotints, a process to which he was introduced by his friend, the poet e.e. cummings. The outbreak of World War II drove Hamaguchi back to Japan, but he returned to France in 1953 and devoted himself almost exclusively to mezzotint printmaking. Within a few years, his prints were winning international acclaim, and this success inspired him to continue refining and expanding his mezzotint skills.

The mature phase of Hamaguchi's career, from the mid-1950s onward, shows a well-integrated combination of Japanese and Western aesthetic sensibilities. His images often depict rather simple subjects, but with great subtlety and attention to evocative, rather than descriptive, visual effects. <I>Three Poplars</I> is an excellent example of Hamaguchi's extraordinary skills. The print features three elongated ovals- the poplars referred to in the title-floating on a field of undulating stripes.

(7.9 × 45.1 cm),"Large Japanese Kutani charger possibly Edo Yoshidaya AO Kutani revival period.  The design consists of two carp swimming through water weeds in rich vibrant enamels.  Bottom has Fuku ""Happiness"" mark on base.",Gift of Judith Gerson in honor of John L. Young,Japanese,Edo Period (1615 - 1868),"Most Japanese porcelain was historically produced in the Arita region on the southern island of Kyushu. Of the few porcelain production sites that were located on the main island of Honshu, perhaps the most important was the area around the village of Kutani in Ishikawa Prefecture. The first Kutani porcelain kilns were established by the ruling Maeda clan in the mid-1650s and operated until the early eighteenth century, with a revival of production at the end of the eighteenth century. The establishment of the Yoshidaya kilns near Kutani-where this striking charger was produced-took place around 1825. 
<br><br>
Following a style that had been popular in the middle of the seventeenth century, Yoshidaya Kutani porcelains typically feature dense designs painted in four main colors: yellow, green, dark blue, and purple. The designs are usually natural motifs that sometimes have additional symbolic meanings. The fish on this charger, for example, are symbols of wealth and status. In the Chinese language, the word for fish sounds like another word that means abundance. Furthermore, the word for carp resembles another word for a government official and so Chinese artists often used images of carp to signify a wish for riches and high social rank. Although such linguistic puns do not work in the Japanese language, Japanese artists still followed the Chinese conventions, and images of fish appear frequently in Japanese visual and decorative art from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In the following year Edward, then King Edward VIII, would abdicate in order to marry her. When the photo was taken, she was a figure of popular fascination, at the height of society and fashion.

Man Ray’s photo is an image of stark elegance and careful geometry. Mrs. Simpson’s pale face is framed by a chic wave hairstyle, set off by the darkness of the background and her fashionable Chinese <I>cheongsam</I> gown. She gazes at us from the apex of a triangle, as she leans in to match the angle of a Chinese statue of a Buddhist Heavenly King. The Chinese elements were stylish exotica of the period, but also perhaps a nod to a decade earlier, when she spent a year in Warlord-era China. A final subtle note is created by the embroidered hem of the gown’s front flap, a line pointing directly to the wedding ring that represented the source of her controversy.

Nureyev began formal training with Alexander Pushkin of the Leningard Ballet School at age seventeen, eventually becoming a soloist with the Kirov Ballet. In 1961 he sought political asylum in Paris, where he enjoyed a career as a guest artist in more than thirty ballet and contemporary companies. In the nude portrait, Avedon’s white background and overhead light source direct our eye to Nureyev’s chest, allowing the viewer to envision both the expansion induced by such a posture and its fleeting temporality. The blurring at his feet emphasizes Nureyev’s motion. The inclusion of film roll edges in the study, however, insinuates that time has elapsed between shots, creating a sense of imagined movement from frame to frame.

While in the original configuration the two daughters are located on the margins of the family—standing behind or apart from the central familial unit—here they have become the main subjects. The fan, the lace, and the flowers are all objects that have taken on gendered connotations, and here these tools for the subjugation of women are rendered tangible and used to reconfigure the position of women within the family. Though they all bear marks of deterioration, perhaps signaling the datedness of feminine signifiers or commenting on the rigidity of gender expectations, they are still imbued with physical power and the ability to reshape traditional narratives of family and gender."

Walter (OC 1957),American,,"Without artistic attribution or date of creation, this photograph is free of context and history and thus open to myriad meanings rooted solely in its iconography. Capturing a female figure kissing a male bust and their reflection in a mirror, the photograph recalls the myth of Pygmalion. In Ovid’s telling of the myth, the sculptor Pygmalion falls in love with his own creation—a perfect woman rendered in marble—which comes to life and bears his child, thus bestowing him with the capacity of both aesthetic and sexual (pro)creator. The Napoleonic military hat that adorns the male bust identifies this statue as an authoritative and dominant figure, further underscoring the gendered power play within this image. The photograph then might be viewed as an inversion of both Ovid’s male-centric myth and of the historical precedent for male power: in this telling, the woman reclaims her potential as an active agent, procreator, and rightful generator of meaning, rather than the passive object of the male gaze and desire, located in the lifeless and disembodied torso of a man.

Charnay’s group landed at the eastern seaport of Tamatave and spent three months exploring inland territories and making contact with local chiefs.

Observers have also commented that this print produces an electric charge that transforms the viewer’s experience from one of passive witness to participant in an interactive event.

Exploring ideas of journey and transition, viewers of this piece were meant to enter and walk through it, experiencing the interior of the structure and the complex play of light and shadow through the wooden slats. Taking inspiration from ship building, Stackhouse's pieces are strong and solid, but also ephemeral given their temporary nature and the lightness lent by the spaces between the slats.

In the portrait, Mori appears as a perky but vacuous plastic pop star, an image of erogenous artifice in a vinyl cyber-schoolgirl outfit.

Frame: 34 1/4 × 28 1/2 × 1 3/4 in. (87 × 72.4 × 4.4 cm)","Half-length, three-quarter view portrait of a young man wearing a yellow, blue and red vest. Though turned slightly to his proper right, he looks directly at the viewer while holding a quill pen in his proper right hand.",Peter and Barbara Smith Goodman (OC 1949) Fund for American Art,American,,"From the late seventeenth through the nineteenth century, American portrait painters -often anonymous and untrained-traveled widely in search of commissions. Ammi Phillips, perhaps the most well-known and celebrated American folk artist, was a self-taught itinerant painter who worked in New England and New York in the first half of the nineteenth century. Phillips's work covers the full range of portraiture. His early style, before 1820, is characterized by the use of pastel colors and lightly colored background space, with a charming, simple handling of the subjects. His later portraits are darker in tonality and rich with detail in costume and props such as books, flowers, dolls, or animals. Phillips's early and late styles are so different that art historians, working from unsigned canvases, originally thought they were the work of two different artists. 
<br><br>
Phillips's portraits present an intriguing window on the families he met and the culture of which he was a part. His masterpiece <I>Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog</I> (1830-35; American Folk Art Museum) is the quintessential folk art portrait: a charming depiction of a young girl with a remarkably direct gaze, full of personality and with her pets in tow. 
<br><br>
The AMAM portrait probably dates to about 1820, the period of Phillips's transition from his early style to a naturalistic immediacy. The young man's blue velvet coat with gold buttons, pink-and-blue striped vest, and jeweled cravat pin enhance his intelligent gaze. Although the sitter's identity is not certain, provenance information suggests that he was probably a member of the Kenyon family of Claverack, New York. Phillips was working in New York's Columbia County in 1820, painting portraits of members of the Schuneman and Kenyon families. The portrait is in excellent condition and is preserved on its original stretcher.

Late afternoon light tints the snow-covered hills, giving Ochtman considerable freedom to construct muted color harmonies. Balancing the dominant blue-green chord of the painting, he depicted houses in a complementary chord of orange and pink, and mixed these opposing hues with white to model the contours of the hills. Ochtman's delicate brushwork in the stand of trees on the left and the distant woods on the right contributes to the serene mood of the painting, while his more active strokes in the foreground suggest the uneven surface of the snow.",Jim and Anne Sunshine (OC 1946/1947) American Art Fund,American,,"Born in the Netherlands, Leonard Ochtman moved to Albany, New York, with his family when he was about twelve years old. After a year's study at the Art Students League, followed by brief ownership of his own studio in Albany, Ochtman relocated to New York City in 1885, sharing a painting studio with fellow Albany artist Charles Warren Eaton. Their work exhibited the tonalist style popular in earlier American landscape painting of the 1870s: a soft, muted palette creating a contemplative mood. Both artists admired the brooding landscape painter George Inness, who was their age and had a studio in the same building. 
<br><br>
In 1891, Ochtman and his wife, the artist Mina Fonda, left New York City and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. Among the attractions of the area were its proximity to New York, its rural character, and its views of Long Island Sound. Ochtman designed their new home, Grayledge, overlooking the Mianus River, which was partly funded through a mortgage provided by their neighbors, the art collectors Henry and Louisine Havemeyer. As Ochtman lived and painted along the Connecticut shore, his work shifted to a brighter, but still subdued palette, influenced by John Henry Twachtman and artists connected with the developing American Impressionist movement. 
<br><br>
<I>Winter Afternoon</I>, executed the same year that the Ochtmans moved into Grayledge, is almost certainly a view from that house. Its luminous orange, pink, and blue tones capture the late afternoon light of a New England winter landscape. The brilliant white of the foreground snow and the subtle play of shadows are characteristic of the landscapes popularized by Ochtman and his American Impressionist colleagues. The AMAM painting is a superb example of Ochtman's work made at the height of his career, when he was most closely associated with American Impressionism.

Another first came in 1837, when Oberlin enrolled four female full-time students in a baccalaureate program of study alongside male students.

Frame: 114 × 78 × 5 3/4 in. (289.6 × 198.1 × 14.6 cm)",,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,English,,"Sir Thomas Lawrence was a highly esteemed portraitist who began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in London soon after moving there in 1787. His works were both naturalistic and flattering, and the artist quickly became a favorite of the upper classes in Britain. Lawrence was painter to both George III and the Prince Regent, the future George IV, exhibiting his first portrait of the latter in 1815, the year both the AMAM works (AMAM 1986.17 & 2010.14) were likely begun. 
<br><br>
These pendant portraits have been recently reunited after decades apart. Lady Wigram was acquired by the museum in 1986, and her husband, Sir Robert Wigram, is the most recent acquisition in this handbook, acquired in 2010. Together, they tell a story of marital love, business, foreign trade, and philanthropy in early nineteenth-century England. 
<br><br>
Lady Wigram (1767-1841), Sir Robert's second wife, is shown wearing a black velvet gown, white ruff and Indian shawl with paisley decoration; an ermine robe that attests to her wealth is folded over the sofa. Her costume alludes, in part, to her husband's business interests in the East Indies, as shawls such as hers were imported from Kashmir, while the gown and ruff were fashionably ""Elizabethan"" at the time, reflecting British patriotism after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. Her affable expression and calm demeanor conform with what is known of her life; she bore her husband seventeen children (he had six already from his first wife) and she was well known as ""Lady Bountiful"" in Walthamstow, Essex, for her philanthropic activities, organizing coeducational schools and medical clinics, and founding a local library. The portrait was exhibited at London's Royal Academy in 1816. 
<br><br>
Sir Robert (1744-1830) was instrumental in convincing the government to build the East India Docks in 1803, and the papers under his right hand resting on the table once showed the lettering ""EID con 1803"" (now only partially visible under UV light, perhaps because of a previous restoration in this area) in reference to that construction. He was one of the company's original subscribers and was on its construction committee, serving later in 1810 as chairman of the Docks and becoming a director of the company in 1815, the year this portrait was likely started. The books at lower left, one of which is entitled ""East India Docks,"" additionally refer to his business activities. Wigram first came to London in 1762 where he apprenticed with a Dr. Allen and became a surgeon, serving on ships to the East Indies from 1764 to 1772. He contracted an eye disease in China and ceased sailing, became a drug merchant in London and later a Member of Parliament, and was created a baronet in 1805. Well known for his energy and business acumen, the diarist Joseph Farington wrote of him that he ""should be miserable if in a morning he should not awake with his head full of ideas of business for the day."" 
<br><br>
Sir Robert, depicted here with a frank, open expression, had said of Lady Eleanor, ""I never did undertake any business of moment without consultation with my wife, and I can truly say it has much promoted my fortune."" These wonderfully painted portraits are evidence of their compatibility and harmonious marriage, even as they allude to Sir Robert Wigram's successful business dealings, the burgeoning of trade, and the language of fashion in the early nineteenth century.

During his career, he painted more than 200 portraits of friends and neighbors in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Typical of his style, these two full-length portraits are silhouetted against a plain background. The identity of the man and the woman are unknown, however, this is likely a family portrait as Maentel often created double portraits for a husband and wife. Maentel’s works provide a charming glimpse into the lives of those he encountered, visible here in the details of the baby reaching for the mother’s face and the dog playfully biting the man’s top hat.

Similar to Close's other production, it focuses on the face of one of his acquaintances. The intimate photograph, however, differs greatly from the large-scale, hyper-realistic close-ups painted on canvas for which Close is best known. For this work, the artist chose the anachronistic medium of the daguerreotype, the first form of photography invented in 1839. In contrast to film-based photography-which is endlessly reproducible-the daguerreotype image is unique, and is directly transferred onto a metal plate. The shiny surface acts like a mirror, and the image appears to shift according to the viewing angle."

The series title <I>Blue Phase</I> stems from the color of this issue of the <I>cruzado</I> note, which features an image of Juscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961.

Native to Cuba, in 1984 Bedia was initiated as a priest of Palo Mayombe, a religion introduced to the region by slaves from the Congo. Taking its name from the Spanish word for “stick,” Palo is centered on belief in the spiritual power of the Earth and natural objects. To facilitate their rites, practitioners of Palo (Paleros) create consecrated vessels known as <I>Nganga</I> that are filled with such materials as dirt, sticks, and bones, and thought to be inhabited by spirits of the dead.

Bedia illustrates a Palo ritual in the monumental ink drawing <I>Con Licencia</I>, whose title translates to “with permission.” At the center of the composition, a kneeling supplicant pre-sents a machete to the waning moon and requests permission from the creator-god Nsambiampungo—highest deity in the Palo pantheon—to cut down a plant emerging from the ground as an appendage of the personified Earth. Connecting moon, supplicant, and plant is a diagonal axis formed of the words of the Palero’s chant, scripted in a mixture of Spanish language and Kikongo dialect. The symbol rendered directly above the severed plant is known as a <I>firma</I>, or chalk drawing composed of graphic elements like arrows, crosses, and circles to facilitate a specific ritual.

This image is part of Paglen’s series <i>The Other Night Sky</i>, in which he mapped and photographed the nearly 200 top-secret U.S. surveillance satellites then orbiting the Earth. The barely-visible path of the satellite (located left of center in this photograph) is recorded over a long exposure; it travels in the opposite direction from the trajectory inscribed by the stars. According to the artist, this particular satellite, known as Cosmos 469, “was a Soviet nuclear-powered reconnaissance satellite launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 1971. Although Cosmos 469 has been inactive for decades, the spacecraft (and its BES-5 nuclear reactor) will remain in Earth’s orbit for 600 years.”<br>
<br>
The American desert has long been a site of governmental and scientific experimentation, the operations of which are usually invisible to all but a few. Paglen’s view of the American West is far less romantic than the one propagated by earlier landscape photographers, and even by the Land artists who created work there in the 1960s and 70s, who viewed it as largely virgin terrain."

Marville had been commissioned by Baron Haussmann to document the neighborhoods of Old Paris that were scheduled for demolition. Marville took more than 400 photographs, which were published in 1865 under the title L’Album du vieux Paris, or Album of Old Paris. Many of Marville’s photographs combine fine archival detail and documentary value with an eerily poetic or lyrical quality.

Priests blessed and “activated” the figures, instructing women to care for them as they would a newborn child. Women often carried them in the waistband of their skirt (as Ashanti babies are carried), presented them with strands of beads as gifts, and projected onto the figures their hopes for a beautiful, healthy baby. It was believed that by interacting with the figure (each decorated with unique symbolism), one would deliver an attractive child and know how to care for it.<br>
<br>
The back of the head features geometric ideographs, which refer to adinkra (symbols of concepts) and Ashanti proverbs. Originally, strands of beads or fibers would have been pulled through holes around its head. The beads around the figure’s neck would be given to the newborn, transferring to it the magical and health-related properties of the figure. The unusually tall height of this example suggests it may have been displayed rather than worn, as it would be impractical to carry."

Indeed, the connection between the D’mba or Nimba mask and fertility are apparent in the image itself; that of a stately woman who has given birth and raised children; her long breasts attesting to her years as a mother and child-rearer.<br><br>

The notion of fertility however extends to the very earth; some have seen this mask as the Baga concept of an ‘Earth Goddess’ though this is overstated. In any case, the mask presides over all agricultural festivals.<br><br>

D’mba represents not only the fecundity of the fields but the fertility of the women of the village as well. As such, the mask dances at all major rituals and festivities of village life as well as agrarian rites, in order to bring symbolic increase.<br><br>

Masks of this type are worn over the heads and shoulders of the dancer with a long fiber and cloth costume, completely obscuring the wearer who carries the sometimes 60 pound mask on his shoulders, running with a large retinue behind him. <br><br>

The raised coif may have a secondary meaning in referencing rows of planted crops in the fields. The scarification on the face and chest imitate long outdated scarification patterns on Baga women, and further reference female fertility.<br><br>

The mask also has a role in the Simo society in promoting fertility in a more direct manner, namely for women having difficulty conceiving.<br><br>

The unusual shape and form, and the necessity of utilizing Western cloth of blue or black, may imply that this mask was actually developed relatively late in Baga cultural history and was heavily influenced more by the peoples of the areas the Baga came to inhabit after their migrations to the current region.

The majority of Bamana artistic expression is related to one or another of these organizations, which require masks, power figures, and statuary for their ceremonies.<br><br>
 
This figurine, almost certainly a Nyeleni figure, would have been used in men's initiatory grades among the Bamana as an object taken out and danced during later parts of the boys' initiations and depicting a young, nubile woman in her prime, therefore representing the female aspect to the boys now initiated as men.<br><br>

Nyeleni figures depict the most beautiful and desirable attributes of the woman:  Large perky breasts and buttocks, an elaborate coif, and beautiful skin. The classical Bamana characteristics of the face are also clearly indicated; long straight nose, high brow, and small pouting lips.<br><br>

Unlike the famous seated Gwandasu figures, which depict a woman of high rank with hunting accouterments, Nyeleni figures are more primary and abstracted based on sexual attributes of womanhood. The scarification markings do in fact imitate Bamana models, however the style fell into disuse, but remained integral in the works of art.<br><br>

It should be noted that figures of this style are often attributed to the Bamako region based on the morphology and the seated posture, though the distribution and specific artistic particularities may make this regional attribution spurious.<br><br>

Of great importance is the excellent and original patina, evidenced in this example (which in most other examples has been altered or lost).  Additionally, the harmonious interplay of the balance between the length of the arms, which in this example are not reduced to simple vestigial paddles, and the gentle bends of the legs, contrasted with the simple abstractions of the face, give the Gould example an unusual quality of abstraction and naturalism within the same composition.

The Bangwa are a people living on the periphery of the Cameroon grasslands, almost to the frontiers of the Cross River, bordering Nigeria. As a result of this cultural intermix, the style of Bangwa objects is far more vigorous and animated than that of their Central Grasslands relatives.<br><br>

This figure depicts a titled nobleman, perhaps even a chief or Fon, sitting on a titleholder’s stool and wearing numerous bangle bracelets and necklaces. His posture is indicative of alertness; he sits forward, listening with open eyes and barred teeth. <br><br>

Such bangles would have been made of Ivory and worn from the wrist to the elbow. The necklaces would have been made of valuable beads. The coif is actually a type of cap that is favored by the nobles and royalty.<br><br>

In times of difficulty as well as during the investiture of a new Fon, a figure such as this would have been ritually anointed with oils, and the chief sorcerers of the court (other than the Fon himself) would make invocations to the ancestral spirit represented, to alleviate the difficulties that the ancestor’s descendants were facing.<br><br>

Divination among the Baule is a spirit possession event; the diviner or an assistant is taken over by a spirit of nature that the diviner may be familiar with or be in a relationship with as a tutelary.  Such spirits are known as Asie Usu.<br><br>

The diviner usually holds an undecorated iron gong in his hands and strikes it with the decorated striker. The striker will be specially carved by a professional carver and will depict iconography that is relevant to the particular diviner, spirit, or divination praxis in general.<br><br>

This example is a fantastic work of carving; with the handle carved as a beautiful and delicate female figure with elaborate scarification, while the actual gong beater is in the form of a stylized buffalo mask, known as Bonu Amuen.<br><br>

The iconography is open to speculation; perhaps the handle of the gong beater is the tutelary female spirit that the diviner has entered into a relation with, or perhaps his spirit mate who, by being represented on an important object bestows blessings upon him in his marriage and sexual life.<br><br>

The mask at the top represents one of the most powerful masks in Baule traditional masking, in the form of a buffalo from the bush, which is not allowed to be viewed by women.<br><br>

This contrast of the iconographic elements would have been profound to a Baule viewer; a beautiful female figure standing with the symbol of male power and magic above her head, perhaps implying that as a nature spirit, she unifies the seeming opposites.<br><br>

The Baule are most well known for their images of ‘spirit mates’ that are carved for an individual when faced with a domestic or sexual problem. This however is not such a figure in that it depicts two individuals, a male and female (probably mates) and the surface of this tableau, rather than being enhanced by polishing or painting, or in rare cases, the addition of materials like gold, has a dark crusted surface related to sacrificial uses and unusual iconography.<br><br>

The Baule figures make encrusted surfaces for two reasons; the first, to be spirit figures not related to the ‘spirit spouse’ genre but to embody Bush spirits, and in the second case, figures may be carved to represent or embody tutelary spirits for the diviner. In the latter case, the figures are often carved as pairs (as we see here) and are heavily encrusted with blood sacrifice from animals.<br><br>

The use of the drums is esoteric; it may well have been a part of the diviner’s ritual, as drums are used in such divination. The entire object may have been a complex form of divination spirit receptacle, complete with drums and offering bowl.<br><br>

It should be noted that this is not a unique piece; others exist, and are simply referred to as ‘shrine objects’. Indeed the documentation for this work states that the piece is from the ‘nanfoue’ Baule, among whom this type of iconography is typical for such a diviner’s object.

The use of these figures is also not well documented – a rare photo from the 1930’s  shows two Nyamwesi or Sukuma figures in situ, displayed against a wall. We have no idea if they were displayed this way for the photograph, or if they were originally kept this way in a shrine.<br><br>

The contacts led to profound changes in cultural traditions and among the art styles of the people concerned. As is the case with the Kongo peoples, the early contact led to a sense of heightened naturalism as well as an adoption of European prestige objects for nobility or royalty.<br><br>

The stool has always been one of the primary objects in the art of Africa; often as a visual reminder of status, as few cultures, particularly in Central Africa, allow all of their citizens to utilize the same kinds and styles of stools within the same tribal context.<br><br>

The early adoption of the European chair by the Chokwe, Lwena, and Lunda immediately created a prestige object that was at once a classical throne or high stool, as had previously been the case, but also a valuable and important object referencing the power of outsiders who had shown greater strength than the local powers.<br><br>

Over time, the use of such chairs by royalty gave way to the wholesale carving of such objects in a completely traditional context, for any chief that could afford it. Indeed, photos exist from the 1950’s of Pende chiefs who had close ties to the Chokwe using chairs such as this example as well – the tradition was spreading.<br><br>

This chair is a classical example of a mid-twentieth century Chokwe chief’s chair. The chair back has the usual ancestral figures on each strut, however the central backrest image has been replaced by animal imagery. The bottom bear maskettes are Chokwe in origin and would have had little or no relevance to a Pende or Lwena chief. The usual figures abound: dancers, animals, royal personages and masked individuals.<br><br>

It should be noted that iconographic changes were not due to any other pressure than local carvers trying to outdo one another with elaborate and unusual designs that redefined the idiom.

Though ethnically referred to as “Dan” these people are really a pastiche of related peoples who share a common Mande ancestry and language. When speaking of the “Dan” style of carving, most people actually mean the ethnic sub-groups of the Gio, Kran, Kono, or Mano. This particular example comes from the Kono/Mano Gio people at the Guinean frontier in Liberia, near Saniquelle.<br><br>
	
Masks are used by the Kono/Mano people for a number of sacred and profane performances – public dances may be preformed in the village for all to see and enjoy and usually are of a didactic nature, enforcing social mores and good behavior. The sacred masks however, fall under the domain of the Poro secret society, which is in charge of the initiation of boys and men.<br><br>

It is however extremely difficult from simply examining a mask to determine what role it may have played in Dan culture. This is due in large part to the fact that Dan masks are quite multivalent, and for that reason a mask may have several potential uses, within a larger framework; the specific role being related to rank of the dancer who owns or has possession of the mask. As the dancer rises in rank in the secret Poro society, the mask too, would rise in rank and take a new name and new roles in performance – in some cases without any change to the carving, costume or decoration of the mask itself.<br><br>

For this reason, Himmelhaber and Fischer created a system of classification for Dan masks that breaks them into twelve types, based on morphological variants. Within each of these types of masks, individual masks may have many layers of additional functions or abilities when performing.<br><br>

This particular mask is of the type known as Gagon, which is a beaked mask that acts as an agent of social control. Masks of this type, represent important bush spirits that often appear with assistant masks that interpret their messages. Among the Kono proper, these are among the most important and high-ranking masks known.

The Awa Society made over 70 different types of masks and divided them into many categories. Among the most important and ubiquitous masks of the Awa is the satimbe mask.  The Satimbe depicts a female figure standing atop a mask, or in some cases sitting or squatting.<br><br>

Masked dancing among the Dogon is most often related to funerary practices. Upon the death and the anniversary of the death of individuals in society, large numbers of masked dancers would reenact cosmological mythology and ritualized beliefs of the afterlife.<br><br>

In the case of non-funerary masked dancing, harvest festivals, and rituals that occurred at specific intervals in years were also a cause for large scale dancing. The Satimbe mask functioned in both contexts.<br><br>

The female figure atop the mask depicts Yasigi, the mythological Dogon woman who among other things was the one who introduced the type of dance skirt worn by Dogon masked dancers. Other variants of Dogon mythology have Yasigi aiding in the Dogon adoption of masking traditions itself. In any event, the Satimbe mask and its many variants appears in nearly all Dogon dance rituals.<br><br>

Originally, this Satimbe mask would have been painted in bright colors and often decorated with long fiber attachments.<br><br>

The very fact that a large number of Dogon masks have entered museums and private collections with a worn surface (such as in this example) and lacking all attachments attests to the abandonment of many of the traditional dances in Dogon communities.

In reality, the general Western notion of Vodun as a dark system of spirituality based on black magic and curses, is almost the opposite of the actual system of thought. Vodun is largely a protective religion based on the manipulation of objects by ritualists who are able to establish through spirit mediation a return to status quo when things have gone amiss either by the witchcraft of others or by the individual's ignoring of ancestral or cultural taboos.<br><br>

The figures carved for Vodun are sold in marketplaces and are completely powerless at that stage – merely empty receptacles for a spirit or power that only the ritualist can add. A figure such as this would have been purchased by a family (due to its size) and when empowered would have guarded or protected a compound. The face retains the heavy blood sacrifice, usually of chickens.  At one time, the figure was likely completely wrapped in a red cloth that was saturated and caked with blood. It is obvious to see why such an object would have been disposed of when the piece was removed from context.<br><br>

In traditional use, figures such as these, with locks and occasionally heavy rolls of rope and coils of metal, far from being images of darkness ‘binding a spirit in’, were quite benevolent. In fact, the vast majority of ‘lock fetishes’ were made to protect the family compound by removing the evil temptation of a spouse to ‘stray’, hence the figure would have new locks added at each marriage in the family and would symbolically aid in the binding of the couple together in the presence of an ancestral figure.<br><br>

The central cavity in the abdomen was once likely filled with some form of organic matter or sand from a grave of an ancestor; this would empower the figure, but would also be important enough to remove before selling to Westerners.

This initiatory society is found in various forms and utilizes masks in almost all contexts. Among the Holo particularly, the most common masks are related to Suku ‘hamba’ masks, and are worn by the boys themselves at various stages during their initiation.<br><br> 

The bell shaped mask is made of a hollowed out single block of wood that completely covers the head of the dancer.<br><br> 

Unlike the Yaka and Suku, the masks of the Holo most often have no surmounting imagery, and merely have a specific coiffure. In fact, it may sometimes be the case that masks of the Suku from certain areas that are simply carved are mistaken for Holo objects, and this may indeed be the case here. Ultimately however, it makes very little difference as the peoples grade into one another at the frontiers of their territories anyway.<br><br> 

This mask is a fine example of a Holo or Suku mask; the face being well carved and pigmented, and the overall use of coloration quite fine and powerful.

Additionally, their charming demeanor and congenial and subservient nature in the masquerade represent the idealized social characteristics of the Igbo concept of the feminine.<br><br>

One of the most notable features of these masks is the large coiffure. The crested coiffure is a sign to the Igbo of wealth and high social standing, and as such, it is featured on the mask in elaborate form.<br><br>

Maiden masks are mostly danced during agricultural festivals though they also can have a role in the funerals of prominent Igbo villagers. On the occasion of funerals, maiden spirits are invoked along with other spirits as “escorts” of the highly respected dead into the next world.<br><br>

During the agricultural ceremonies, maiden spirits appear to watch over the village and  promote good harvest and overall prosperity. Compared to the menacing and powerful male spirits, the maiden spirits dance with playfulness and are meant to entertain both the living and the ancestors.<br><br>

There is a more serious note to their joyfulness and playfulness, however, as these maiden spirits incarnate the ideal female behavior, in the ideal female body; a combination rarely if ever found in this world. Thus there is always in the background the notion that these spirits are the spirits of the idealized ancestors and as such, the dead.<br><br>

There have been attempts to reconcile these stylistic modalities in terms of assigning each ethnic group a particular style, based on a few examples collected during the German colonial period in Tanzania and attempting to extrapolate from there.<br><br>

The difficulty with this approach however is that the peoples in question are active living cultures which, in point of fact, are in many cases living in reciprocal relations with one another. Therefore the styles that may have been found among a specific group may at that time have been found among their neighbors as well. Jumping ahead seventy or more years, the situation only becomes more complex.<br><br>

It is best in such cases to ascribe the attribution of figures such as this not to one ethnic group but to an area or cluster of peoples or simply use a regional approach, such as a ‘Northeastern Tanzanian Shrine Figure’ rather than the original attribution of “a Kamba Fetish Figure’. In truth, we have no real evidence the piece is strictly Kamba, nor do we know that it was a Fetish. It did however serve in a shrine, and is from the general region of Northeastern Tanzania, that the Southern Kamba, among other peoples, inhabit.<br><br>

Additionally, since it is not a more valuable or rare example if it were to be determined to indeed be Kamba as opposed to Doe or Pare or Zaramo, the specific attribution is almost meaningless.<br><br>

The figure itself is a tour de force of figural carving; the volumes of the body change from the bottom up; the legs and hips swell with fertility, the abdomen is narrow but with large forward thrusting breasts. The arms seem almost an afterthought, and the head, though carefully and delicately carved seem to be almost vestigial.<br><br>

Such figures may have had some connection to fertility rites for obvious reasons, though it is also possible that the figure may have been used as a tutelary spirit in initiations. Too little is known of the region to say with certainty.<br><br>

What is clear is that this fine old piece occupied a place of pride and importance in a family or village shrine, or was the property of a ritualist, who maintained it and cared for it for a great deal of time. This exceedingly rare figure is a powerful reminder of the quality and scarcity of Tanzanian art.

The Bwoom mask is quite possibly the autochthonous mask of the region, with variants in nearly all of the Kuba sub-groups.

This fine old mask probably dates to the reign of Nyimi Bope Mabinch (1939- 1969) and was re-beaded by order of the current Nyimi, Nyimi Kwete sometime after 1971. Therefore, the beadwork on the mask is newer than the mask itself, which is quite common among the Kuba.<br><br>

The Kuba are a strictly hierarchical society though, with each group divided into dozens of ranks and titles that correspond to privileges and responsibilities in society. Within this context, the cup of a nobleman has to be more decorated and elaborate than that of a commoner.

This piece a nobleman's cup.  It is made as a figural cup with complex carving that indicates the status and wealth of the individual who owned it. The motif is a visual pun; the male figure that is the body of the cup, reaches behind to hold a standing female figure who becomes the handle, and thereby the means to hold the cup.<br><br>

Interestingly, the vast majority of the cups used by the Kuba traditionally, such as this example, were actually carved by Western neighbors of the Kuba: The Lele and Wongo peoples.<br><br>

Over time, as most of the old specimens of these cups were collected and sold by the original owners, the newer examples that appeared were carved by the Kuba-Bushoong themselves and are clunky and of poor workmanship.

This sacred and living chronicle of the culture could also be referenced should a dispute arise based on descent.<br><br>

To achieve this goal and memorize the enormous amount of Luba oral history, members of the Mbudye society utilized a mnemonic device known as a Lukasa. The Lukasa was always of generally rectangular form, with one or two heads rising from the top, probably representing original ancestors.<br><br>

The body of each board however was different, in that the various stories of the heritage of the Luba were represented by beads or incised designs, that the particular society member would be able to remember by touch or sight. For example, a specific set of migrations of a certain chief might be represented by five beads; each a single place that the chief stopped at on the way to his ultimate goal. The importance of each may be augmented by using a larger bead for a more important point.<br><br>

Additionally, some Lukasa simply have raised or incised designs, serving the same function – at once appearing as a simple board with strange patterns, each line or group of designs would represent a complex part of the oral history; sometimes taking hours to recount an area no larger than a centimeter square.<br><br>

Animal masking was once quite common in Luba country, but seems to have virtually died out in the middle of the 20th century. Shortly thereafter, animal masking in the form of various animal Kifwebe masks, adopted from the Songye, filled the void among the Western Luba who created an entire menagerie of animals in this new style.<br><br>

This mask would have been from the time period of Luba masking in a traditional Luba context, when they made masks in styles that were their own. During this time period, masks of various animals such as elephants and perhaps monkeys were created and utilized by a Luba dance association.<br><br>

Masks of this type are extremely rare and few examples exist in collections; it is possible that a movement spread across Luba country at some stage that was responsible for the destruction of a large number of such masks, though this is purely conjecture.

The blackened surface would have been polished to shine and then oiled – often stove-black was used to make the masks deep black in color. The shiny surfaces referred to the oiled skins of young women, a sign of beauty and youth.

Mbuya masks depict dozens of characters, from the chief, to the ancestors, the recently deceased, clowns, prostitutes, and elders. Additionally, new mask types are constantly evolving based on the needs of the community, and the preferences of the dancers.<br><br>

Pende Mbuya masks function in public spectacles as well as having a role in the initiation of boys, known as Mukanda. In public however, the masks have profound influence, even being able to chide and abuse the chief if he is known to be breaking with traditional mores and violating taboos.<br><br>

The most recognizable of the Mbuya masks is the Mbangu, which is divided vertically down the face in black and white, and depicts a severe case of deformation due to a stroke or Bell’s palsy. These masks have come to be called ‘sickness masks’ after the French ‘masque malade’ or ‘deformity masks.’  In reality neither is an accurate term to describe the mask, as the mask does not represent a sick individual as much as it represents a known and respected individual (in this case a well respected hunter) who has fallen ill with facial paralysis due to his transgressions of societal rules. In this sense, the mask’s primary message is not one of illness or deformity, but the price that is paid for violating the rules that govern Pende life.<br><br>

Much has been written about the supposed ‘oppositional duality’ of black and white, and the mask has in some cases been interpreted in that narrow structuralist binary form. 
However, while structuralism has some very valid points to make about binary opposites as a means of human thought (based originally on Hegel) this mask is not in any way really depicting an oppositional system that is mediated by a synthesis.<br><br>

These masks are simply powerful didactic tools among the many that the Pende use to maintain social control and enforce rules and regulations.

The dancer is completely hidden by the large fiber costume.<br><br>

Minganji are used to police and discipline young initiates in Mukanda initiation and make sure that women and children do not interfere. As such, these masks are often terrifying to the Pende people as they represent wild and uncontrollable nature spirits that are related to the initiatory camp – itself a place of ambiguous character, being partially of the village and partially of the bush.<br><br>

Occasionally, these masks will appear at the death of a chief, the investiture of his successor, and curing rites associated with certain illnesses. In such instances, the masks assert a connection between the initiatory system and the village.<br><br>

Minganji such as this example are the rarest and most important: with a large circular facial area, they are known as the Gitenga sub-variety - the grandfather or chief of all other Minganji masks.<br><br> 

Appearing first at the beginning of Minganji dances, the Gitenga moves slowly with dignity and holds a bell in one hand and a staff in the other; symbols of rank and power also utilized by the village chief. The form of the mask refers to the setting solar disk or the moment of the dawn – a time of ambiguity – neither night nor day and therefore, a symbol of life and regeneration. Others of the Minganji series of masks embody death, uncertainty, and darkness.<br><br>

The superb state of preservation of this example is notable, with the Blue Curacao and hawk feathers still completely surrounding the mask and the surface still retaining its red coloration. The white line on the forehead and coloring of the eyes and mouth may indicate connections to the world of the spirits and the ability of the mask to see and speak for things ‘not of this world’.<br><br>

Sandawe art is rare and important for study as the Sandawe are one of the few Tanzanian groups who are probably autochthons and are more closely related to the Khoi San speakers of Southern Africa than most of their closer neighbors. It is indeed likely that the Sandawe are among the last peoples of Tanzania who did not intermix into extinction with the Bantu peoples that migrated into the region many centuries ago.<br><br>

With regards to art, the Sandawe create objects influenced by the neighboring peoples. For example, short clubs or staffs with heads carved at the top are found all over Tanzania as a form of prestige object, probably replacing a true weapon that the Bantu used in the region long ago.<br><br>

This staff is a classical Tanzanian prestige staff. However, the simplicity and attenuation is peculiar to the Sandawe and is far more compelling and accomplished than the staves of influencial adjacent peoples. It is also a far rarer example, there being only a handful of true Sandawe pieces that do not show marked influence of outside sources.<br><br>

Staves of this type, as among other Tanzanian peoples, would have been carried by respected elders or nobles and would have been an immediate sign of their status in society. The thin staff of this example almost precludes its use as a true weapon, but it may indeed have been used for personal protection. One should also bear in mind that elders in Central African society traditionally had the right to beat younger people of either sex for apparent societal transgressions. The present example seems fit to render a solid beating to a young person who would not be allowed to fight back.

The Kifwebe masking society maintains social order on Songye culture by reinforcing positive male values among initiates, and by performing publicly and maintaining order on the village level. Kifwebe masks are best known for their striated surfaces; often colored in red, white and black. The primary colors refer to life, death, and transformation; day, night, and sunset.<br><br>

The masks of the society may be generally broken down into three basic forms: the female mask, which is generally mostly white with a finely striated surface and rounded head without a crest; the young male mask with striations in bold colors with a low sagittal crest, and the elder mask, which has a high sagittal crest and generally wider striations than either of the other two masks.<br><br>

The female mask is associated with the moon and beauty, mystery and divination, while the youth and elder masks are associated with maintaining order.<br><br>

This mask is a classical elder’s mask; with a high crest and vibrant alternating bands of red and white. The mask would have been part of a fully netted costume and also would have included a long beard laced into the double set of perforations at the bottom of the mask.<br><br>

This mask would have performed in public dances, but would also have had a very strong role in secret meetings. These meetings would have taken place in the Kyobo, or sacred Kifwebe hut, where the organization kept its paraphernalia and where initiates would eventually come to learn about the masks and masking and its role in Songye society.

Called nkishi by the Songye (minkishi in plural), these figures were made to protect and aid the individual, family, or community.<br><br>

Minkishi were created by the Songye in several sizes. The largest and most notable were figures for the benefit of an entire village or community and were over a meter in height. Such figures were considered dangerous by the community and handled only by ritualists who had experience with the powerful forces at work in the figures. Often community figures were entrusted with the task of protecting or increasing fecundity in the village and for keeping epidemic illness away.<br><br>

By contrast, the figures created for individuals or families were made by a ritualist to remedy a specific problem or ailment such as an illness or unsuccessful period of hunting or farming.<br><br>

To the Songye, the figure was simply the receptacle of the active ingredients, called bijimba, that would be added to the image by a ritualist. In most cases, these ingredients were disparate organic and inorganic materials, referencing the power of their source via sympathetic magic; parts of birds of prey, arrowheads, and stones or dirt from a grave of a notable trapper may go into the charm material of an nkishi used to increase the success of the hunt, for example. Once completed, the charm would be inserted into cavities in the figure’s head or abdomen, or wrapped around the figure in small bundles often made of reptile skin.<br><br>

Once the figure was no longer deemed efficacious, it would be disposed of. Often the charm would be removed and destroyed by a ritualist, leaving only the carved figure, which now had no value to the Songye since it no longer had any functional purpose. The majority of Songye figures that have found their way to the West are in this condition.

The classical Yaka or Suku prestige cup is also called a ‘pinched cup’ in that the sides bend inward to almost touch one another. Such cups are said to be styled after a calabash form, and the delicate carving of the inward pinching walls is considered a sign of a virtuoso carver.<br><br>

The cups are further decorated with geometric motifs on each side or occasionally with a face. This example is extremely notable in that beside the usual pinched form and face motifs, the cup has a small handle that extends out form one side and bears a small face on the end.

With a breakdown in this balance, inauspicious events such as sickness, infertility or unexpected calamities occurred and were regarded as proof of witchcraft or evil sorcery, or conversely, the failure of the individual to obey the social mores that maintain stability. 
In such a case, a ritual expert or Nganga was required to rectify the problem.<br><br>

The role of the Nganga was to prescribe a specific charm, or nkisi (plural minkisi), consisting of a plethora of materials based on sympathetic magic that when added together and ‘activated’ by some means at the Nganga’s disposal would serve as an effective countermeasure to rebalance the natural forces gone awry.<br><br>

Most minkisi were little more than packets containing various organic and inorganic materials such as remains of predatory animals or stones and sand from the graves of powerful chiefs. However, in certain cases, the form taken was that of a human or animal figure empowered as an nkisi by the insertion of the prescribed materials into cavities in the body or added to the body of the figure itself.<br><br>

This nkisi figure is masterfully carved as a naturalistic standing male; his face strong and aggressive, and his hair a complex of feathers and other organic objects in a complex coif. The body is covered by a large quantity of various magical materials. The figure is ‘empowered’ by the addition of the nkisi charm in its belly and possibly in other cavities as well. The addition of white pigment to the face connects the nkisi with the spirit world.

Like many Southeastern Congolese people, the Yaka practice a form of initiation that circumcises the boys and teaches them the social customs and religious thought of the Yaka people called Nkhanda.<br><br>

This initiatory society is found in various forms across the region and utilizes masks in almost all contexts. Among the Yaka particularly, the most common masks  are called Kholuka, and are worn by the boys themselves at various stages during their initiation.<br><br>

The Khouka mask is made of a wooden facial covering that is attached to a fiber collar and is extensively painted. Many Kholuka masks also have an elaborate superstructure that is made up of figures in various poses and made of fiber and wood.<br><br>

The surmounting imagery often features female figures or couples in sexual or otherwise embarrassing poses.This imagery partakes of song refrains exchanged between dance leaders and bystanders. All of this is simultaneously charged with humor, giving bent to expressions that in other contexts would be serious execrations. Songs also continue initiation themes in which the hardships of the initiation camp are recalled, including the abstinence of Nkhanda officials. All of this proceeds much to the amusement of the crowd participating in the sung refrains.<br><br>

This mask is a fine example of the Yaka Kholuka mask; the face being well carved and pigmented. The superstructure is complex, depicting male figures with carved wooden hands and heads. What the specific iconographic meaning may have been for the figure is lost, however aesthetically it is well balanced and appealing. This is a fine Yaka mask with good evidence of traditional use.

One theory is that the Nganga would take on aspects of the spirit the mask depicted and retrieve the stolen or damaged soul of the individual who had been sickened by witchcraft.<br><br>

Some masks occasionally imitated the naturalistic carving of the chiefly power figures, and the powerful yet delicate and naturalistic features look quite similar.<br><br> 

However, as in the case of this mask, possibly those linked to individuals not associated with high rank or chieftainship, the canon of style was far less dogmatic with wide variations existing both regionally and sub-regionally.  In stark contrast to the facial carving of other Yombe works, this mask appears to reference a different tradition entirely; the surface being of natural brown wood and of almost crude form rather than the heightened naturalism usually seen in Yombe art.<br><br>

It may be that the masks used by such ritualists had a very broad canon of style. Another possibility is that the masks were carved by the individual diviners themselves on occasion--this would account for the tremendous variation in quality and form.

Though executed in numerous stylistic variations indicative of specific carvers or ateliers, these sculptures all depict youthful females on raised pedestals and holding infants on their laps or, as in this case, in their arms. The bodies are often covered in classical Kongo scarification, while attributes such as coiffure and ornamentation indicate nobility. The infants may lay supine or with bent arms and legs.<br><br>

It had been assumed that these sculptures depict some combination of the mother of the chief, the principal wife of the chief, or in the case of a figure with a supine child, a wife of the chief whose child had died, and functioned as royal images or memorials.Others suggest that these images were used in connection with a woman’s fertility cult.<br><br>

This maternity figure is a tour de force of Kongo carving as much for its absolute mastery of canonical elements as for its successful juxtaposition of the sensual and the arrogant - the youthful perky breasts, full cheeks and fleshy body of the fertile woman, in contrast to the rigid posture and expression of phlegmatic nobility, which creates an inner tension within the composition that is both dynamic and compelling. It is also an extremely rare example as the female figure is standing and holding the child as opposed to sitting cross-legged.<br><br>

Gelede dances and feasts, held over a period of several days, honor the great mother and the Mothers of society. Masks of the Gelede society range from simple to extremely complex and are usually danced in pairs by male dancers. A costume further added breasts and an often-pregnant belly, along with skirts that move in a sinuous manner when the dancer shakes his hips.<br><br>

This mask is interesting and remarkable in many ways. The superstructure is extremely complex and must have been very difficult to carve and to maintain without damaging it. Further, the iconography is very complex. Usually one finds simple iconographic elements; a bird, a simple hat, or a burden basket, but here a menagerie of animals and other imagery is depicted.<br><br>

One may speculate that the birds atop the mask represent spirit intermediaries; the serpents may be related to the cosmic serpent that becomes the rainbow, or may simply represent the watery realm of earth, in contrast to the skies that the birds relate to. The carved knives at the sides of the mask and bells next to them may reference hunters.<br><br>

It is not really possible to know exactly why this particular iconography was chosen for this mask, however, it clearly illustrates that the carver was not only excellent in his medium but understood the canonical iconography and manipulated and juxtaposed it as needed by his patron to a degree not often encountered.

The patinated surface clearly indicates that this piece was in a shrine where offerings were made and that the piece developed an accretion of materials that, while not obscuring the figure in any way, attest to its age and traditional use.<br><br>

Based on the cult of the Mwana Hiti dolls in the region, it is obvious that maternity is a very important concept among the peoples of Northeastern Tanzania; the image itself perhaps depicting an actual mother of an individual or the spirit of maternal power that could be kept and fostered in a shrine to help and protect an entire family."

Such an object would be stored in a cave or some other natural shelter in between initiation cycles and would belong to the head of the initiation camp. Such a figure would have changed ownership by being handed down from one chief initiator to another.<br><br>

The figure is enigmatic in that it does not present any sexual morphology at all. It is possible that like some Yao carvings, it was an image of a pubescent girl before she began to develop, in which case the figure would have been used for girls initiation. On the other hand, the figure may also represent the boys before they are truly considered men, and in a spiritual sense, are not yet gendered per se.<br><br>

Ono has continued to promote interactivity in her later works. In <I>Touch Me</I>, Ono instructs the participant to “add [a] colour painting” to the blank canvas, and then invites him or her to touch its painted surface through the text-shaped openings in the plexi layer. <I>Touch Me</I> playfully addresses the taboo nature of touch in an art museum setting."

(32.4 × 20.3 × 27 cm),"Miniature English Victorian townhouse, with furnishings; in cast resin, plastic, wood, paper and fabric",Gift of Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz,American,,"Born in London, but raised primarily in Lagos, Nigeria, Yinka Shonibare often refers to himself as a “post-colonial hybrid.” As both British and Yorùbá, Shonibare focuses on duality and examinations of race, representation, identity, and the complicated relationship that exists between Europe and Africa in the wake of colonialism. 
<br><br>
In Dollhouse, the artist playfully subverts the Victorian tradition of producing custom-made dollhouses for wealthy families as miniatures of their lavish homes. Here the artist has replicated his own Victorian town house in London. As in other projects, Shonibare has chosen to “Africanize” an English subject as a critique of imperialism. The furnishings show significant use of batik fabric. Ironically, even as such fabric has strong African associations, its origins are actually Indonesian. Popular in West Africa since its introduction during colonialism, batik fabric is typically exported to the continent from British and Dutch manufacturers. Dollhouse also includes framed miniatures of a painting by French Rococo artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard and of one of Shonibare’s own photographic works, which portrays the artist as a dandy in a Victorian home library. Both emphasize the fusion of Eurocentric and Afrocentric influences within this work. Yet Shonibare’s sequestering of Afrocentric elements to the interior emphasizes that “African-ness” must often remain hidden in the private sphere, behind the facade of English identity.

This process image of the cast of a human head—stoic and yet bearing apparent blemishes—brings forth parallels between the traces left by the artist’s hand on the surface of the sculpture, and the traces of light that produced the photographic image.

Smith writes that birds are “stand-ins for souls,” referring to the Catholic conception of the Holy Spirit. For Smith, birds connote fragility, and their delicate existence symbolizes the ephemerality of nature and the mortality of all living things.

Saint-Tropez represented for him at once a utopian environment and a source of tremendous artistic inspiration. He adopted themes of communal work as opposed to Parisian industrial labor, which depended on class divisions and bourgeois capital. The beauty and luminous colors of Saint-Tropez stirred within Signac a vision of harmony, which he transformed here into an aesthetic analogous to the social equality of his political ideals."

Over the chest pockets are mirror images of a pierced heart—one red and the other a black silhouette—a reference to the Catholic image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and a symbol of Christ’s suffering. A miniature portrait peeks out of one pocket, while out of the other emerges a leafy plant—pierced with nails and decorated with red, white, and green ribbons—that encircles the artist’s head like a halo. The vine further extends to form a canopy over a second self-portrait, depicted on a <I>trompe l’oeil</I> scrap of paper, to which the black-clad figure also points with his finger. In this vignette, ropes bind the artist’s naked torso as he brandishes the Mexican flag, partially covering his face.

The ties binding Zenil’s body may refer to the hardship and constriction experienced by the artist as a homosexual male living in a conservative, Catholic society. In lieu of the national motto “Viva México,” or “Long Live Mexico,” as inscribed on the pictured flag, the title of the drawing instead declares “Long Live Liberty,” perhaps a demand for personal as well as political freedom.

Visible on the floor of the open tent is a photograph that depicts an extreme close-up of the surface of the artist’s own skin, peppered with freckles, moles, and hair. The juxtaposition of leather and human skin—the “two skins” of the work’s title—also serves to conflate the corporeal with the architectural, as elements associated with the body are given a new structural form. For Henríquez, the association of the body with shelter relates to her experiences of geographic displacement as an immigrant.

The organic leather contrasts with the industrial metal sheet, while both take the form of basic geometric shapes. In its placement directly on the floor, <I>Two Skins</I> shares much with Minimalist and Post-Minimalist sculpture, requiring the visitor to walk around the work to fully take it in.

Reflecting Duval-Carrié’s interest in the rich history and culture of his native country, which are permeated by the presence of colonialism and Vodou religious traditions, <I>Justicia</I> stems from a body of work created in Paris. The painting represents a decisive moment in the history of the Haitian Revolution waged by African slaves from 1791 to 1803. It depicts one of the last major battles of the conflict in which the rebels, led by former slave and future emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines, emerged victorious over the French army. Dominating the composition is the allegorical figure of Justice, who intervenes on behalf of the rebels. The army’s encampment is nestled into the dark, lush landscape, while a uniformed officer sits at her feet in the left foreground. Depicted with colorful wings and Creole facial features, Justice is armed with her attribute of the flaming sword; smaller swords similarly decorate the bodice and full skirt of her European-style dress. Draped above the scene is a banner of blue and red—colors of the Haitian flag—as well as a plaque that identifies the allegorical subject.

At the bottom left is the Lone Ranger’s sidekick Tonto, a fictional character that Smith often employs in her work to indicate her disapproval of a subject. While the four-part circle at the center of the composition can be interpreted as a Native American symbol for the four seasons or the cardinal directions, it also suggests the crosshairs of a rifle. The red garment is a Native American war shirt, a ceremonial piece of clothing that for the artist represents religious philosophy, democratic ideals, and social wisdom.

In this print, a table overflowing with seafood in the foreground distracts the viewer from realizing that the New Testament scene of the Supper at Emmaus is being “unveiled” by a servant in the background. According to Saint Luke’s gospel, two disciples were eating dinner with a stranger who they recognized as the resurrected Christ when be broke bread at the table.

A cornucopia of apples, peaches, plums, lemons, currants, and several kinds of grapes are united with a white porcelain reticulated basket filled with strawberries, a milk-glass footed compote brimming with red currants, and a lower table top with peeled lemon and a halved plum, creating an atmosphere of rich abundance.",Peter and Barbara Smith Goodman (OC 1949) Fund for American Art,American,,"An extravagant arrangement of fruit and grape vines spills out over the edge of a two-tiered marble tabletop. This stunning opulence is an impossible one: these fruits have different growing seasons and would never have appeared together on a 19th-century table. By uniting them here, Severin Roesen creates an enticing but fictional image of lavish abundance.<br>
<br>
Following the Civil War (1861-65), American politicians promoted a variety of fruit growing projects to unite farmers across the country in the shared goal of boosting the economy. These efforts drew on a rhetoric of national expansion that advocated the “civilizing” of stolen Indigenous land by clearing it for agriculture. Roesen’s still life tacitly endorses this agenda by showcasing the bounty of American soil and the wealth generated by its cultivation.<br>
<br>
Born in Germany, Roesen moved to New York in the late 1840s. In 1862 he relocated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he made this painting. Known as the “lumber capital of the world,” Williamsport boasted more millionaires per capita than any other American city. It offered a ready market of lumber barons for Roesen’s still lifes, who likely appreciated his visual celebration of the expanding country’s seemingly limitless resources."

Porter’s playful reverence extends to other art historical figures for whom she has great respect, such as Belgian Surrealist René Magritte, whose treatment of objects as signifiers parallels Porter’s own approach to her inanimate subject matter.

Muybridge used a line of multiple glass-plate cameras with tripwires to study the effects of motion on humans and animals, creating an early form of stop-motion photography that produced images showing what the eye could not distinguish as separate. During the 1880s, he worked under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzing locomotion and creating the photographic portfolio <I>Animal Locomotion</I>, which deeply influenced the fields of athletics, biomechanics, and the visual arts.

The same year in which Manet produced his iconic image, the American Civil War had reached its midpoint. Nefertiti Goodman alludes to the cultural atmosphere of that period in this print, using various symbols associated with the Antebellum South: a floor-length dress resembling a hoop skirt, a hand fan, and the lush flora in the background. Through her choice to depict two African American women—a servant and the more affluent homeowner—Goodman turns our art historical assumptions back on us. Additionally, this work seems to undercut the superior status that painting has held over printmaking in the history of art. The enormous size of Goodman’s image requires viewers to dispel hierarchical categorizations that, in the context of art museums, favor large-scale paintings over smaller works on paper."

<BR>
Perhaps the ultimate fetish object, the red high heel takes center stage in Willie Cole’s <I>Rapture</I>. Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí had explored the fetishistic power of the red pump in his infamous assemblage <I>Scatological Object Functioning Symbolically (The Surrealist Shoe)</I>. Dalí's intention was that a sugar cube be dissolved in a glass of warm milk placed inside his wife’s shoe, which he envisioned as an enactment of the Freudian desire to return to the womb of the mother, represented by the milk. In < I>Rapture</I>, by contrast, Cole completely de-fetishizes the red pump by converting its repeated silhouette into an abstract, all-over pattern reminiscent of African textile traditions. Cole frequently creates such Africanized forms by transforming household objects into symbols of power and memory.

While at first glance this landscape may appear to be a faithful documentation of the natural world, it is not.<br>
<br>
Sand developed a technique to create imaginary landscapes based on the chance interactions between paper and pigment. First, she applied pigment to a sheet of thick paper and pressed another sheet on top of it. Then, she used the random shapes created to compose invented landscapes. She explained: “This crushing produced ridges which are sometimes curious. Assisting my imagination, I see woods, forests or lakes, and I accentuate the vague shapes produced by chance.”<br>
<br>
Sand called these landscapes “dendrites” and compared them to the appearance of fossilized plants. This effect is perhaps most evident in the background of this scene, in the mountains and grassy banks of the lake."

On the wall above the stove, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln with a feather behind it (likely signifying flight or freedom) suggests that the woman is, or soon will be, emancipated.<br>
<br>
Thomas Satterwhite Noble made this painting in July 1865, the same month that he surrendered from the Confederate army after four years of service. His paintings related to slavery, made between 1865 and 1870, were his largest commercial success. He sold them primarily to businessmen and industrialists  for as much as $10,000 (approximately $160,000 today).<br>
<br>
This painting was part of a trilogy titled </i>The Past, Present, and Future Conditions of the Negro</i>. Its presentation of a “civilizing narrative” for previously enslaved people, while common at the time, is racist. The artist’s identity as a white man, former Confederate soldier, and son of a slaveholder introduces further questions regarding his motivations: were these paintings a form of atonement for his past actions? Or do these imagined scenes of Black American life, and the financial gains he enjoyed from selling them, amount to a continued form of exploitation?

In the absence of any other context, we are left simply with suspended, “frozen” bodies caught in the transience of movement.

Compositionally and thematically, the lithograph parodies George Caleb Bingham’s famous painting <i>The Jolly Flatboatmen</i>, a romanticized landscape in which all of the subjects are white, charmingly bucolic frontiersmen. In mocking imitation, Chagoya’s subjects morph, contort, and slink into spectacle. The man at the center flaunts a body without skin—he is all bloody muscle and bone—and yet, despite the crudity of his condition, he continues to dance. A large sombrero towers atop his head, marking him as “other,” but also, per his exaggerated, seemingly desperate dance performance, as a “fraud.”<br>
<br>
Historically, the terms “pastoral” and “arcadian” have been used to describe settings that are abundant, peaceful, and pure—untouched by the coarseness of law and industry. In artworks like Bingham’s, the evocation of pastoralism serves to paint western expansion as something natural and virtuous. Yet, we know today that expansionism did not come without its costs, most notably the violent usurping of land from indigenous peoples and the reinforcement of unjust racial and economic hierarchies.<br>
<br>
Chagoya’s reference to pastoralism, however, is ironic. His subjects are no more “at peace” with the American landscape than they are accepted by Bingham’s vision of America. Rendered as if superimposed onto a stock image of the Great American West, the subjects in Chagoya’s print beg the question: for whom does the ideal of an American arcadia serve, and who does it exclude?"

Some Spanish intellectuals initially embraced the French as enlightened liberators, while others maintained their allegiance to the exiled Spanish monarchy. Goya never openly declared his loyalties; he worked for both the French and supporters of the exiled monarchy.<br>
<br>
During these tumultuous years, Goya began producing compact etchings depicting scenes of war and its consequences. While several of these prints take on the character of an eyewitness report, they are not simply documentary accounts of the French occupation. Instead, Goya moves from the specific to the universal to uncover the essence of war, from acts of bravery to scenes of brutality, hunger, misery, destruction, and death.<br>
<br>
Goya never published the 80 prints that would become <i>Los Desastres</i>. In 1863, long after his death, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando published the series. Influenced by the aesthetics of photography—particularly contemporary photographs of the American Civil War—they printed Goya’s plates with an excess of ink, creating a uniform grey tone."

Critical examination of Galen’s ideas began in the Islamic world and continued in Italy during the Renaissance, where knowledge of human anatomy was revolutionized with the systematic dissection of cadavers. These discoveries were spread through the writings of Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564), whose publications included accurate, finely detailed illustrations.<br>
<br>
By the 18th century, new printing techniques that allowed the addition of color enabled artists to create even more literal anatomical illustrations. This print was made by Jacques-Fabien Gautier d’Agoty, an 18th-century anatomist, engraver, and entrepreneur. Gautier produced anatomical illustrations of great richness of color and texture. Early in his career, he drafted illustrations while at public anatomy demonstrations in Paris; later, he performed dissections himself. The figure here is vaguely unsettling, posing as if still alive, accommodating the viewer by holding a flap of his flayed skin to allow us to see the anatomy of his foot."

Situated in the middle ground, Christ goes virtually unnoticed amidst chaotic throngs of masked revelers, arguably functioning as a self-portrait of the artist who felt ignored by society and persecuted by his contemporaries. The festive atmosphere is diminished by the mob-like representation of the populace and the presence of Death wearing a top hat in the foreground. Ensor’s nightmarish depiction of an historical event that never occurred explores the intersection of imagination and anxiety over one’s place in society."

On the show, secret agents stage covert missions to prevent global disaster; in Weems’s ironic appropriation, Jim must accomplish the herculean task that is surviving racial inequity in America. As in many of her works, the story that Weems tells through text is not a didactic description of the photograph, nor is it entirely divorced from the visual narrative.

It was also part of Máo’s strategy to regain political power after being eased out by “revisionists” and other political enemies like Lín Biāo 林彪, his designated successor.

This poster engages the past on a number of levels. The rough style of the lines and simple color scheme recall early Communist posters of the 1930s made by the Modern Woodcut Movement. The imagery, typical of the era, shows a heroic soldier, worker, and student against a backdrop of a public rally. The trio symbolically attack Lín Biāo and Confucius, associating Lín with discredited traditional thought and culture as represented by the ancient philosopher. A clever dig at Confucius is also seen in the Chinese text that refers to Confucius as <i>Kǒng lǎo èr</i> 孔老二.

For Anatsui, the variety of the natural colors and grains of the wood represent the diversity of the peoples and cultures of Africa. The markings have been cut with a chainsaw and blackened with an acetylene torch. For the artist, the tearing of the saw through wood functioned as “a metaphor for the way in which the western powers had carved up and brutally divided the African continent amongst themselves, ripping through and destroying both local history and culture.”<br>

In this composition, the Oga figure looms over the stick figure masses, his expression unsympathetic. The scorched channels in the wood create a physical barrier between the Oga and the people.

Jean Shin is a Korean American artist who currently lives in New York. Her work uses everyday objects such as old shoes, pill bottles, or sweaters, giving them new meaning. Shin turns what was once discarded into something momentous, making the viewer think about what society considers waste. When collecting such objects, Shin asks for donations in specific communities, so her work often reflects the history and identities of these communities. For <i>Steps,/i>, Shin writes, “the specific materials used—the innermost leather and cloth linings—are those that lay closest to the body.” What was once intimately known to us, enclosing our feet, is now disregarded because it is too worn to fulfill its purpose."

(106.2 × 244.5 cm),"Subject is the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",Gift of Driek (OC 1965) and Michael (OC 1964) Zirinsky in honor of the Oberlin College Class of 1965 and the Martin Luther King Commencement Address,American,,"One hour that shaped the American experience is charted here through the procession of stars moving across the sky. This movement represents the passage of time from the moment that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot, in the early evening of April 4, 1968, until the time he was pronounced dead. This work visualizes the arc of the stars as they would have appeared had they not been obscured by the sun. Encapsulating several levels of human perception, this hand-stitched quilt invites us to contemplate how we relate to shared historical experiences. <BR>
<BR>
From 1957 to 1965, Dr. King visited Oberlin several times. His last visit was during the college’s Commencement ceremony on June 14, 1965, at which he was awarded an honorary degree of humane letters and delivered a commencement address titled “Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution.” This speech had a powerful impact on the graduates in the Class of 1965, including the donors of this work.<BR>
<BR>
This quilt was created as part of the artist’s series <I>As Stars Go By</I>, which examines moments of violence from throughout American history that dramatically altered the future of the country. Other events illustrated in the series include the Battle of Wounded Knee, Battle of the Bulge, Hiroshima, and the September 11 attacks. Von Mertens visualizes these acts as pivot points, not only in historical terms, but also in scientific terms, as she depicts the star rotation patterns above these moments in time. Toward the right-hand side of the quilt, one can see the North Star, Polaris, as it barely moves in the sky (being just one degree off the celestial North Pole). The other stars chart longer paths because they are further removed from the Earth’s axis of rotation. During the 64-minute time frame captured here, the stars had moved approximately 15 degrees across the sky. Von Mertens’ stitch-work is faithful to the stars’ movement and apparent colors, from blue to whitish-yellow to orange, which reflect their temperatures and star types. Through its physical size and metaphorical scale, the work captures an almost vertiginous sense of motion and proportion.<BR>
<BR>
 While utilizing computers to research and design her quilts, Von Mertens still completes her work using traditional stitching techniques. As she notes, “The hand-stitched line is an important element in my work. The evidence of the hand evokes time and contemplation, almost as a commitment to the ideas contained within the work...The hand-stitched line acts as a tracing—as if my fingers were slowly tracing the pathways that I am stitching as a way to map them and as a way to understand them.” All of her works are made to fit a single- or a queen-sized bed and are often shown in that form. While Von Mertens’s subject matter stimulates deep reflection, the ultra-traditionalist methods she employs to create her quilts also suggest notions of comfort and domesticity.

Sanín’s earliest work had a gestural, expressionist quality, but she turned to geometric forms in the 1970s and began using only acrylic paint, a decision that enabled her to create flat, undifferentiated fields of color like those seen here. (Many of her works are titled after her material of choice.) Sanín creates a sense of depth in her paintings through overlapping forms and variations in color brightness and saturation, generating the optical effect of certain shapes advancing or receding into space. The final product is deceptively simple."

Drum membranes are usually made from from the stomach or liver linings of the bowhead whale or the hides of caribou and walrus. The drum has a round wooden frame, and a singer uses a wooden stick to beat the frame. Singing and drumming together form a vital element of northern culture. Drumming sessions are organized to celebrate a successful hunt and to show gratitude to the animals that gave themselves to the people. Through singing, drumming, and dancing, the web of reciprocity between animals and humans comes full circle. The shaman here is carved out of the fossilized vertebrae of a bowhead whale and illustrates vividly how, in the Alaska Native imagination, human identity merges with that of the whale through artistic, musical and ceremonial activities."

Sedna is the sea goddess, who is universally embraced by the Arctic peoples in Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Greenland.

Sedna is known to control the animals as well as the weather, directly influencing human-animal relations in the Arctic environment. When disturbed, she would cause a storm and prevent humans from hunting and accessing marine mammals. On such occasions, the shaman is asked to placate her spirit.

The two birds appear to be Ingagiurak, associated with sea folks, living along open water and helpful to humans in need. The detailed features made of walrus ivory are nestled within a polar bear skull, and the hair strands that frame the human-like faces are made from the baleen of the bowhead whale.

In a series of photographs taken underwater, Weston examines the female body with the same formalist eye that he applied to landscapes and inanimate objects. Taking advantage of the natural effects of water and light, Weston treats the model’s body as a canvas for rippling lines and shadows. His father Edward Weston was likewise known for his formalist treatment of the female nude: in contrast with Brett’s use of environmental conditions, however, Edward instead framed and lit the body like a still-life arrangement, lending it a sculptural quality."

<br>
Weston used this technique on a variety of subjects ranging from the organic to the inorganic. Some subjects remain identifiable, whereas others are more ambiguous. He employed a number of devices to render common objects strange, such as photo-graphing them from unexpected angles or through reflective surfaces.<br>
<br>
Similar to his fascination with sweeping sand dunes, Weston likewise continuously turned his lens on the subject of cracked mud. Capturing a minute detail of the vast and dramatic landscape of Death Valley, the mud crack motif exemplifies Weston’s interest in extreme close-ups of the natural world."

The variety of landscapes photographed by Weston reflects the breadth of his travels. In 1947, Weston received funding from the Eastman Kodak Company to photograph along the East and West coasts, providing him an opportunity to capture climates ranging from forest to desert. Without access to a darkroom on the road, Weston sealed off the windows of his car to process film in the back seat. Subsequent travels took him to Japan, Alaska, and various locations across Europe and Latin America. Weston spent his last years in Hawaii, where he was inspired by yet another type of landscape.<br>

<br>
Weston spent the latter part of his life in Hawaii, where his photographs focused on the natural landscape of the islands. While many of Weston’s landscapes remain consistent with the conventions of the genre and possess a clear foreground, middle ground, and background (such as Mono Lake, California, on view nearby), Clouds and Landscape diverges from this standard composition. More akin to his formal studies, Weston focuses on the shape of the mountain and deep contrasts of light and shadow."

Taken during Weston’s first stay in New York, this photograph depicts a storefront window displaying multiple advertisements for soda and cigarettes. In keeping with his other photographs of the city during this period, the shop window is presented as an isolated slice of the urban environment, the window highlighted as an architectural space like a stage. The advertisements—some of which appeal to customers to buy war bonds—offer a glimpse into contemporary consumer and political culture.

The dunes became a popular motif for both father and son, and Brett returned to this type of landscape across California and New Mexico throughout his career.<br>
 <br>
The junior Weston approached the sand dunes as an opportunity to experiment with abstraction. In this example, he takes advantage of raking light to emphasize the deep, curving shadows that rhyme with the topography, creating a composition that suggests a two-dimensional pattern. The landscape is further estranged from its context through the elimination of a horizon line.

Geerken, Friends of the AMAM",Haitian,,"In the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, enslaved Africans fabricated a series of ritual systems today called Vodou. Though its name derives from <i>vodun</i>, a word referring to spiritual forces in Benin and Togo, Vodou pulls from a range of western and central African religions: Catholicism, native Taíno beliefs, Freemasonry, and European mysticism. The religion’s sumptuous, lively ceremonies often begin with dances performed by members who serve the <i>Iwa</i> (spirits), who carry elaborate flags sacred to specific <i>Iwa</i>. The flashy sequins covering the surface of this work come from a period when dressmaking factories were common in Haiti, and employees collected fallen sequins to use in decorating <i>dwapo</i>. By the late 20th century, artists began to produce elaborate sequined <i>dwapo</i> for sale to collectors and for the export market. This <i>dwapo</i> was likely produced by an artist active in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Port-au-Prince in the 1980s or 90s. Its title and <i>vèvè</i> (ritual design) honor Marassa, the personification of twins. The three circles in the design, however, pay homage not just to twin children but also to the child born after them: a strong-willed third aspect of Marassa, which is called <i>dossou</i> or <i>dossa</i>, depending on the child’s gender."

She stands upon a boat that transports her through a sea of crashing waves inside of a dark grotto. Tanning portrayed a world that seems peaceful yet haunting. At the lower right, a bird nest cradling five eggs rests atop a wooden board that moves calmly along the rolling waves; on the boat’s bow, an eye with two irises eerily confronts the viewer.

The text and image in this work offer multiple references to loss and suffering, relating to two revolutions in the Middle East—while also registering the ongoing tensions between Egypt and Iran while Neshat was at work on the series."

response to a move she made from Harlem, New York, to Englewood, New Jersey. Not
feeling connected to this new home, she looked to the history of the area, sharing
stories of those who had traveled through it on the Underground Railroad."

The lighter undersides of the leaves flash with a silvery luminosity, standing out against the darker green of the leaves behind them. Two egrets, their fuzzy plumage creating a shimmering outline, share a branch at the lower right of the painting. The branches themselves are given a sense of texture and volume with an ink-pooling technique, tarashikomi 溜込, which was incorporated into Japanese painting in the early 17th century. In a style somewhere between realism and idealism, the artist has captured an almost palpable moment: we expect to hear the rustle of the leaves in the wind.<br>

As a teacher at the Kyoto City University of Arts, Yamaguchi Kayō influenced generations of Japanese painters. A painting prodigy, he began his art studies at age 13, was accepted into national exhibitions at 17, and won his first national award at 18. This painting was entered in the 2nd Imperial Fine Arts Academy Exhibition (Teiten 帝展) when the artist was only 21. Like many Nihonga paintings in that exhibition, Egrets with Willow was probably mounted in a large frame and later cut down for a more convenient folding-screen format."

I draw grid lines on the subject matter of my work: walls, floor, tables, books, bottles and jars. … Everything becomes more interesting with a grid on it. The objects take on more weight and more appeal because they are within vertical and horizontal lines. It also makes me more conscious of the negative space. It’s a musical concept.

Employing toy soldiers and painstakingly crafted miniature sets, Levinthal re-staged for the camera the German army’s tragic campaigns into the Soviet Union in 1941-43, which resulted not only in millions of casualties, but also contributed to the army’s defeat and the eventual collapse of the Third Reich. At first glance, the images perfectly mimic typical war photography, capturing soldiers in close-up and vistas of regiments on the move and in the midst of battle, dramatically shrouded in the fog of gunsmoke and poison gas.<br>
<br>
Created at the height of the Vietnam War, <i>Hitler Moves East</i> pointedly raises questions about the distortions of photographic representation, the (im)possibilities of re-enactment, and the role imagination plays in the production of historical knowledge. The images are ambivalent in the way documentary photography often is, leading one critic to characterize the series as “a serious chronicle of war and a sympathetic—even moving—portrayal of the soldier’s hopeless stoicism.”"

The lines of the painting—a Pop treatment of ornamental features found on classical building façades—draw attention to the other lines that define the space, from the thick verticals of the radiator to the rails and spindles of the chair that sits below the canvas. The strong horizontal band of light that transverses the space nods to Lichtenstein’s own process for painting the entablatures, which entailed photo-graphing New York buildings at noon, when the contrast between light and shade on their classicizing façades would be strongest."

",,"Early in his career, Ohio-born Jim Dine was considered a Pop artist, given that he frequently used everyday objects as subjects. Yet his career is multifaceted and defies categorization; what is certain is that he often takes up themes relating to mechanical processes, and tools—perhaps inspired by his grandparents’ ownership of a hardware store. Here, he riffs on the ornate iron gate at 172 rue de Grenelle, in Paris, the entrance to the studio of Aldo Crommelynck (1931–2008), a Belgian master printer with whom the artist collaborated closely. Ever inventive with materials, Dine had the image printed in black and silver ink on a surface prepared with a synthetic polymer.<br>

In an essay on <i>1¢ Life</i> published in Artnews the year after the book was completed, Ting wrote a tongue-in-cheek description of each artist who had contributed a lithograph. He affectionately wrote of Dine, referencing the artist’s ubiquitous bathrobe motif: “Great thinker as Newton. He must feel cool all the time, that’s why he makes so many robes for winter.”
<br>
<br>
Dine developed a distinctive approach to the depiction and interpretation of common images and everyday objects in paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture, elevating them to an almost iconic stature. He repeated selected themes, such as the heart shape seen here, over and over. Through repetition of the motif detached from its normal context, it became identified with the artist and his personal iconography. Here, though, the bright colors and vigorous patterns evoke Ting’s art.

Transforming the museum’s central gallery into a vortex of text and object, the installation mined the AMAM’s collection and Oberlin’s history.

For the exhibition, he brought together a wide range of works from the AMAM collection and the college archives, putting them in dialogue with assemblages he crafted on site from locally sourced materials.<br>
<br>
Wilson transmuted this grindstone, made from sandstone quarried in nearby Amherst, Ohio, into a symbolic representation of slave labor through the addition of ten brass figures, nine of them cramped in the center (reminiscent of the hold of a ship) and the tenth poised outside, literalizing the proverbial expression, “Keep your nose to the grindstone.” The figures, cast brass Asante goldweights used to measure gold dust, invoke the commodification of Black bodies central to the triangular trade, which rendered human chattel equivalent to metal wares, cloth, guns, and other goods."

<i>MacArthur Nurses</i> inverts the famous World War II photo of General MacArthur wading ashore at the Philippine island of Leyte in 1944, fulfilling his promise to return after being driven out by Japanese forces in 1942. Wofford’s nurses, mirroring the historical image, signify in part the large number of Filipina nurses working overseas, but also the long and complex history of the Philippines as a former U.S. colony, a complexity reflected in the figures themselves. The nurses in the foreground stride forward purposefully, their heroic, idealized forms raising transnational labor migration to an iconic plane.

",American,,"Sam Gilliam is a pioneering and experimental Black artist who began his practice in Washington, D.C. in the 1960s, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. The AMAM has collected his works, in a range of media, since 1970. This work was printed at the Brandywine Workshop in Philadelphia, which has been supporting printmaking by artists from culturally diverse backgrounds since 1972. Gilliam was the workshop’s first artist-in-residence in 1975, the year <i>Wissahickon</i> was made. The print takes its name from a tributary of the Schuylkill River in Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, the word “wissahickon” being a corruption of the Lenape word for “stream of yellowish color” or “catfish creek.”"

Sheet: 35 1/2 × 35 1/2 in.

However, a closer look reveals that the natural forms in the image are composed of details from photographs of contemporary urban environments, with rubble piles, dilapidated apartment buildings, and distant skyscrapers. <br><br>

A solitary figure stands in the center of the image, evoking the traditional Chinese motif of a small, lone person in a vast landscape. These figures, with whom the viewer may identify, are usually shown as if in contemplation, observing the harmony of the natural world. Here, however, the scene is much more ominous as the man stares into his ramshackle surroundings. In this context, the contemporary ruin reveals the physical consequences of urbanization, construction, pollution, and demolition, with the isolated man embodying alienation, dislocation, and despair. The sense of the rapidity of modernization and rejection of the past is heightened by the ancient religious sculptures being compressed and buried beneath the debris.

A colony of riled sand-swallows circles around them. The picture’s caption— “how many eggs?”—suggests that the children are involved in a game to collect as many sand-swallow eggs as possible. In the face of the Industrial Revolution, Homer’s image harkened back to a simpler way of life, represented by scenes of outdoor play and leisure. Here, Homer’s subjects assume a manifold relationship with the land on which they play. On the one hand, the children’s game can be perceived as natural and resourceful, provoking a kind of symbiosis with their surrounding environment. On the other, their “raid” is intrusive, even exploitative, as it encroaches upon the birds’ natural habitat."

",Gift of Peter G. Gould and Robin M. Potter,Lwena,,"Across central Africa, figurative staffs signal the social status, authority, and cosmopolitan connections of their owners. In this example, the prominent, valorizing depiction of a woman underscores the importance of women in these matrilineal societies. Soft, naturalistic features likely associate this staff with Lwena sculptors in the borderlands of Zambia and Angola. Yet the figure’s coiffure displays an uncommon—likely imaginative—mixture of local hairstyles. This accumulation of influences speaks to how these commonly traded objects often incorporated iconography and styles from neighboring groups. A small amulet around the figure’s neck hints at hidden powers and protection, but the binding around her ankles and feet connotes servitude, and may allude to the long histories of slavery and indentured labor that undergirded men’s power and social status in this part of central Africa."

",Gift of Peter G. Gould and Robin M. Potter,Senufo,,"This composite figure—perhaps unique in Western collections—illustrates the reuse of powerful objects in African ritual contexts. The body of the figure originally was part of a sculpture that represented a spiritual force for Sando, a prominent Senufo matrilineal society with a powerful branch of diviners. The head and right arm of the figure were broken off at some point, either accidentally or deliberately. Later, members of Poro, a secret men’s society also in Senufo regions, adapted the remains for their own ritual use. While there are a few known cases of fully realized Sando figures being adopted for use in Poro rituals, this figure is the only one known to have been repaired and adapted for this use. The head that was added and bound to the original Sando figure represents a korubla mask of the type used in Poro initiatory rites. This head still displays heavy encrustations of chewed and spat cola offerings accumulated during its use as an amulet or ritual object by a member of the Poro society."

After the 1880s, a rare form of figural carving emerged in the region: large posts that served as watchful guardians over markets, thoroughfares, and the graves of prominent community members. Mortuary posts like this one were raised by relatives of the deceased in lavish ceremonies, usually a year after their death. Scholars debate the extent to which these effigies were supposed to represent the deceased ancestor. Though some posts incorporate personal adornments and scarification patterns, such details—if they ever existed—have disappeared from this example.

Beyond the unique beauty of the different types of rocks placed in the gardens or studios of Chinese scholars and officials, such stones were seen as a kind of domesticated or educated form of nature.

Particularly prized, however, are rocks of this type, top-heavy and punctuated with a network of holes and indentations. The overall shape is reminiscent of Pénglái 蓬萊, one of the legendary Islands of the Immortals, described as a mountain that rises from the Pacific Ocean on a small base. The many holes suggest the magical Daoist cave-heavens (dòngtiān 洞天), a network of caverns and underground tunnels that were believed to connect sacred sites throughout China. By looking at this rock, a scholar could appreciate its distinctive visual qualities, connect with nature, and escape by visualizing these magical spaces."

Gaignard’s cast of characters—many styled to appear as though they belong on a John Waters movie set—become multiple lenses through which she can articulate and complicate her own personal background as a biracial woman who often passes for white. 

In Holier Than Thou, Gaignard humorously adopts religious imagery to send up the assumed whiteness of Christian icons and the “very strange” (in her words) optics of black worshippers praying to a white god. The link between race and religion is signaled by the bottles of “White Rain” bath products in the foreground, while the use of a photographer’s light reflector as a halo—which makes Gaignard look like an Art Nouveau goddess—refers us back to the artist’s chosen medium and the role it has played, and continues to play, in the construction of identity."

A true collaboration, as is so much of their work, the chair was designed by Venturi and the pattern by Scott Brown. Inspiration for the pattern came from an old tablecloth that belonged to the grandmother of an associate of the artists; it was modified somewhat, and includes overlaid dashes. As Venturi later noted, “We wanted a pattern that was explicitly pretty in its soft, curvy configurations and sweet combinations of colors, and represented as well something with nice associations, those of flowers. By juxtaposing the two patterns, the dashes and the grandmother-tablecloth, we achieved a design involving dramatic contrasts of scale, rhythm, color, and association, and one that is usable in many ways.”"

<br>
A devout Buddhist, Sangkhum’s careful attention to natural cycles of life and death reflects the Buddhist understanding of impermanence. He melds his Buddhist practice with his artistic process through the painstaking method of mezzotint printing. To get the rich, dark tones in the print, he must repeatedly roll a metal tool called a rocker on the metal printing plate to create the tiny pits in the surface that hold ink. The process can take months. Sangkhum works on the plates in the forest near his studio outside of Chiang Mai, Thailand, meditating all the while to maintain an uninterrupted focus and mindfulness during the repetitive work.

Williams, and Howardena Pindell, McArthur Binion has been equally committed to abstraction for more than four decades. His paintings are traversed by grids hand-drawn with an oil stick, with wavering lines that intentionally resist the cool perfection of Minimalism. The grids are further complicated by Binion’s underlayers of paper, in this case in this case pages from his address book. He refers to this aspect of the work as its “under conscious” and “emotional genepool,” alluding both to DNA—the title of the series—and to Freudian thought.<br>
<br>
Binion’s work tests the divisions that art history has set up between abstraction and representation, or between supposedly apolitical and politically engaged work, a distinction that has plagued debates over what constitutes —and should be celebrated as—“black art.” Binion’s subtle enmeshing of abstraction and autobiography recontextualizes the grid, pointing to Southern quilts and West African textiles, while the artist himself sees the work as occurring “at the crossroads—at the intersection of Bebop improvisation and Abstract Expressionism,” suggesting a dual heritage."

Noda creates prints using a unique process. Starting with a printed photograph, he manipulates the image by erasing with correction fluid and adding with pencil.

</br>
Protesters in the mid to late 1990s, however, objected to celebrating a figure they argued had materially benefited from the transatlantic slave trade. Among the dissenters was Rev. Al Sharpton, who sharply decried the project: “To salute a slave mistress is tantamount to spitting in the face of everyone in Queens and everybody in New York.” Still others objected to the statue of a relatively unimportant royal figure overlooking a Revolutionary War battleground. Though the statue never came to be, Flack remained dedicated to the project and defended its merits, noting that she endeavored to depict Catherine as biracial, reflecting her Portuguese background and paying homage to the ethnic diversity of the borough of Queens."

<br>
Ayón’s elaborate prints bring Sikán back to life, and partly serve as representations of Ayón’s own bold artistic and personal transgressions. Though not religious, she explored religious themes in a time when the Cuban government was suspicious of them; though dealing with quintessentially Cuban subjects, she showed little interest in <i>Cubanidad</i> (Cuban identity) as an aesthetic movement; and though a woman, her work was preoccupied with the symbolism of an image-eschewing, all-men’s society."

Because this was a time of peace, the weapons and armor of the samurai were most often not used for battle but to represent status. Armor was the most visually spectacular form of this public display and was created with the skilled craftsmanship 	of not only metalworkers but also specialists in textiles, lacquer, and painting.<br>
<br>
 For samurai families, the annual Tango no Sekku festival 端午の節句 on the fifth day of the fifth month was a time when boys of the family would set up the family’s suits of armor for public viewing to demonstrate prosperity and to ward off evil. By the Edo period, suits of armor were replaced by dolls or miniature sets of armor like this one, made by the same workshops that made full-sized armor.<br>
<br>
The protective function of this set of armor was enhanced by the golden Buddhist deity you can see on the helmet. Fudō Myōō 不動明王, the “Immovable Wisdom King” is an important deity in Japan, understood in part as a protector and a ferocious foe of ignorance. His appearance, surrounded by flames, glaring fiercely, and grasping a sword (missing here) made him popular with the samurai."

Despite the traditional subject, the women are walking through a field of ripe corn, a plant that was not widely cultivated until the Meiji Period (1868–1912).

In the work here, Ishiyama Tetsuya maintains the functionality of a tea bowl and the sense of unmediated spontaneity seen in wabi-sabi tea ware, while introducing a playful tension with tradition in his careful application of metallic silver and gold glazes. Ishiyama’s control of his medium is unmistakable: although the exterior is silver, the seemingly random indentations, which the artist lightheartedly calls “dimples,” are meticulously covered with gold; furthermore, the golden interior of the bowl echoes the dimples, and reveals a subtle crackle. Avant-garde Japanese artist Okamoto Tarō (1911–1996) once said, “Art is an explosion!” In this work Ishiyama, who has exhibited internationally, introduces his own creative explosion to the customarily serene world of Japanese tea."

Johnson Bequest via Art Rental Collection transfer,German,,"One of Joseph Beuys’s most ubiquitous multiples, the bag How the Dictatorship of the Parties Can Be Overcome embodies his aesthetic ideology, termed “social sculpture.” Beuys argued that everyone was an artist, in the sense that every human has an innate capacity for creativity that can be exercised through daily activities for the greater social good. In 1967, he founded a political party for students and subsequently created several more political action groups, including the Organization for Direct Democracy through Referendum, which lobbied against West Germany’s corrupt parliamentary democracy.<br>
<br>
To advertise the organization’s platform, Beuys printed 10,000 plastic shopping bags with a diagram of the group’s positions on one side, and on the other, a reproduction of one of his blackboard drawings, executed during a public lecture. Beuys fully embraced editioned objects, called multiples, as “vehicles of communication” that could distribute his ideas more widely than expensive unique works. He handed out the plastic bags during a street action in Cologne in 1971, and then sold them for a nominal sum in his Office for Direct Democracy at the exhibition <i>documenta 5</i> in 1972."

She has since documented sites of distress, including Flint, Michigan, through a lens that is intensely personal and political at the same time. This image of her grandmother’s refrigerator belongs to her earliest series, <i>The Notion of Family</i>. A visually dense image, it stands in for the artist’s grandmother, Ruby, whose house is filled with dolls, and for whom the kitchen is a center of gravity. The doors of the fridge are covered with family photos and prints of Frazier’s professional work, the latter printed at a larger scale, with evident skill in composition, framing, and direction. The two kinds of photography intermingle freely, not quite collapsing the bounds between art and vernacular photography, but suggesting that they are equally meaningful forms of representation. This image also serves to contextualize Frazier’s work—which has been lauded in major newspapers and has appeared in numerous gallery and museum exhibitions—through its first audience, her family. The refrigerator is a portrait of a proud grandmother as much as it is a snapshot of Frazier's early career."

Michelangelo Lovelace studied art at the Cleveland Institute of Art and with renowned local self-taught artist Reverend Albert Wagner (also represented in the AMAM collection), but primarily made his living as a nurse’s aide—never, however, giving up his artistic practice. As seen in this work, his paintings often present birds’-eye views of parts of the city, with storefronts, churches, billboards, and a multicultural array of pedestrians, integrating bright colors and sometimes-humorous text in vibrant depictions of the urban scene."

During the Soviet era, the city was known for its industrial production, in particular for military equipment and the Gorky Automobile Plant, and for much of that time it was closed to foreigners.<br>

 Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, the daughter of a diplomat, traveled widely in her youth; she moved to Paris in 1928 from her native Portugal and her works display the influence of Cubism and Futurism that she encountered in France. Later she moved with her Hungarian husband, the artist Árpád Szenes, to Brazil. After World War II she returned to Paris, continuing to paint and draw in a complex, abstract style while also creating prints, ceramics, and designs for tapestries and stained glass."

Feldman,Japanese,,"From a 1973 portfolio of sixty-nine prints by many of the foremost artists of the mid 20th century, Arakawa’s Bonjour Picasso seems at first to be a cheerful note to the artist in brightly colored handwriting, filled with bland niceties. “Dear Picasso, Hello. How are you? How is the family? How is the weather?” However, some of the lines are smudged and unreadable, with hints of a darker message seen in the line “nightmare of history.” The text concludes with a jaunty, “Kiss me quick and write me soon.” The background image—an upside-down detail of Gustave Courbet’s 1855 work titled The Painter’s Studio: A Real Allegory Summing Up Seven Years of My Life as an Artist—may allude to Picasso’s very public role as an artist.<br>
<br>
Arakawa had an artistic career as what he termed an “eternal outsider.” He immigrated to New York from Japan in 1961, reportedly with only $14 in his pocket and the phone number of conceptual artist Marcel Duchamp, who became a patron and mentor. Arakawa and his wife, Madeline Gins, collaborated on a large body of paintings, prints, poetry, installations, and architecture."

The Tongva—who are not recognized federally, despite longstanding petitions—have for many years tried to protect their sacred grounds.

<br>
This photograph comes from the series <i>Earth the Same as Heaven - ’Ooxor ’Eyaa Tokuupar</i>, which documents a series of ceremonial interventions in the landscape. The abalone shell and deer antler seen here belong to Dorame’s father, and the objects were staged at a natural spring where her grandfather used to collect water for their family. The red string, which recurs across Dorame’s photographs and installations, references the string used in surveying and archeological work, though she first began featuring it, as she recalls, “after working on a reburial site where it was a leftover material... used to wrap white sage that we were using in ceremony.” Rather than employing the string to demarcate territorial lines or to measure space, Dorame reinterprets the string as symbolic of “a sort of sinew that connects things,” articulating a continuity between the past, present, and future in landscapes that often appear divorced from time and history."

Burns said of her subjects, “The people I choose to photograph are often those for whom negative or tragically simple attitudes have been formed by the majority of society… In an age of technology and urbanization I am drawn to the boundaries, to people whose existence is self-defined.” Often, Burns uses natural light and shadow to obscure the sitters’ faces and allow them a degree of anonymity.

To create this work, Juan Araujo blew up the Burkhardt image to life size and painted it with painstaking detail on canvas paper, a very smooth, matte material.

(12.1 × 47 cm),,R. T. Miller Jr. Fund,Indian,,"A ring of Hindu goddesses decorates this <i>dhal</i>, a type of shield that had its roots in Persia and Central Asia and was used throughout South Asia from the 16th to the 19th centuries. This shield includes symbolism that is both martial and religious, simultaneously proclaiming the owner’s piety and offering protection from harm.<br>
<br>
A small to medium sized round shield, the dhal was held in one hand. Four metal bosses on the surface covered the attachment bolts for two handles on the back, but could also act as catch points to control an opponent’s weapon. Dhal could be made of metal, rhinoceros hide, or metal covered with leather, as seen here. Beautifully painted shields like this one were intended for ceremonial use, not battle. Although the metal backing may be older, the painted leather covering was made in the 1850s, probably for a Rajput nobleman in the state of Mewar, at the time an ally of the British.<br><br>
Identifying the Goddesses<br><br>
Goddesses are a central part of the diverse religious traditions of South Asia collectively known as Hinduism. One of their many roles is as a manifestation of <i>shakti</i>, the cosmic force of creation and destruction, here represented by nine goddesses in their warrior forms. Seven are part of a group known as the Matrikas, or Divine Mothers, who are the feminine aspects, also called shakti, of important Hindu gods. All of the goddesses hold swords, and six of them hold shields like this dhal. Each is identified below, beginning at the upper right with Durgā and moving clockwise. <br><br>
Durgā: was created from the protective powers of all of the Hindu gods and is not one of the Matrikas but a major goddess in her own right. Her mount is a tiger. She carries a sword and shield, a bell, and a severed head. <br><br>
Indrani: the shakti of the god Indra. Her mount is an elephant. She holds a sword and shield, a trident, and a bell. <br><br>
Vārāhī is the shakti of Varāha, an <i>avatar</i> (earthly manifestation) of the god Vishnu, who took the form of a boar to save the earth goddess from drowning. She holds a khanda sword, a shield, a mace, and a sickle. <br><br>
Brahmani: is the shakti of the creator-god Brahma. She sits on a <i>hamsa </i> (a swan or goose) that holds her rosary in its beak. She carries a sword, a mace, a lotus stem, and a water pot. <br><br>
Ishta-devi: is a generic term for a personal protector goddess. As yet unidentified, this goddess may have been favored by the patron of the shield. <br><br>
Vaishnavi: is the shakti of Vishnu. She rides on Garuda, a powerful bird-man. She holds a sword and shield, a trident, or <i>trishula </i>, and a snake. <br><br>
Maheshvari: is the shakti of Shiva. She holds a sword and shield, a trident, and a drum. <br><br>
Chamunda:  is a form of the great goddess, Devi, rather than a male god. She is part of the Matrikas, but also, like Durgā, is worshipped independently. She sits upon the body of a man, and holds a sword, a bell, and a severed head. The broom or whisk in her upper left hand is more often associated with the goddess Śītalā, known as Sheetla Mata in Udaipur where the shield was made. She protects believers from smallpox. <br><br>
Kaumari, the shakti of Kartikeya, the god of war, rides a peacock and holds a sword, a mace, a goad, or <i>ankus</i>, used to control elephants, and a small vessel. <br><br>
At the center of the shield is the sun god, Surya, from whom many Rajput rulers claimed descent. His image was used as an emblem of the royal court of Mewar, suggesting a royal patron for this shield."

Protectors of entrances and gateways, they first appeared at Buddhist temples and later at entrances to sites of the Chinese imperial court—most famously at the Forbidden City, the imperial palace in Beijing.

Guardian lions were introduced to Japan as early as the 8th century, and were known as <i>Shishi</i> 獅子, a Chinese term that simply means lion. By the 9th century, they had evolved into a pair unique to Japan, with the addition of a <i>komainu</i> 狛犬, or Goguryeo Dog, referring to an ancient Korean kingdom. These were made distinct from the Shishi with the addition of a small horn on the forehead. Also, the komainu often has a closed mouth and the shishi an open one, inspired by the open- and closed-mouth guardian deities (<i>Niō</i> 仁王) placed in the gateways to Buddhist temples. Although originating in Buddhist temples in Japan, they are more often associated today with Shinto shrines."

During the Civil War, she worked for the Union Army and in 1863 in South Carolina was the first woman to lead an armed assault in the war, which led to the freeing of more than 750 enslaved people. An icon in the fight for equality and civil rights, Tubman also worked later in her life to promote women’s suffrage.<br>
<br>
In this print, her courage, strength, and leadership as she conducts a group of people to freedom on the Underground Railroad are communicated by the forceful forward motion of her arm and stance, and her determined gaze. Elizabeth Catlett’s use of a low viewpoint and dramatic sky also impart to Tubman a monumental, heroic stature.

He writes, “It’s an odd subject for a drawing—two gaping dark openings on an otherwise sun drenched hillside. …The subject seemed ripe with potential. The irregular black mouths of these caves suggest all sorts of possible meanings—some perhaps a bit eerie but mysteriously attractive at the same time. … These coke ovens were part of the once widespread coal mining in Northeast Ohio. …Now in disrepair the ovens are slowly being grown over once again by nature.” The ovens were an early fascination of Burchfield, when the latter lived nearby."

The photographs include images of documented stops, but predominantly feature anonymous fields and houses that together imagine the journey of fugitive slaves under the darkness of night. Bey envisions these photographs not just as literal representations of nighttime conditions, but also as an exploration of what photographer Roy DeCarava called “a world shaped by blackness”—by the invisibility that has defined the Black American experience. <br>
<br>
As the penultimate photograph in the series, this image offers a peek of Lake Erie—the final obstacle en route to freedom in Canada—through foliage on shore, a liminal moment tinged by hope, anticipation, and possible unseen danger. The occluded view becomes a coda for the whole series, which embodies the notion, articulated by critic Seph Rodney, that “the act of escaping one’s enslavement is also an act of imagination.”"

To produce this print, Schumacher sent takeout sushi from Lobster Place, a restaurant inside New York’s Chelsea Market, to a collaborator, Taylor Absher, who worked at a nearby 3D scanning studio. Absher scanned the leftovers of his lunch and then sent the scans to a 3D printer used to generate three life-size copies, two of which are displayed here. The scanner had significant trouble “reading” Absher’s lunch, mostly due to the reflective properties of plastic and grease; without its title, the work would be largely illegible, save for the chopsticks visible (to the knowledgeable eye) on top. The blue striations are an artifact of the scanning procedure itself, rendering the imperfect reproductive process of making the work a part of its final form, and perhaps its true subject.

This preliminary drawing for a painting shows how Rajput court painters would work out compositions on paper of a lesser quality before working on the final painting. Here you can see the lines of the initial sketch, and then the darker lines of the more finished composition. If you look very closely, you can see tiny pin-prick holes all along those final lines. This is a technique called “pouncing,” used to transfer a drawing. A painter lays the drawing on the final surface and then pats a small bag filled with coal dust on the drawing, forcing the dust through the small holes and leaving an outline of the composition on the new surface, to be finished with lines and colors."

Baskin had a lifelong fascination with anatomy and collected antique anatomical textbooks.

In nine images this series shows the physical decay of a human body and is intended to encourage reflection on impermanence. The eighth image is of a complete skeleton, and the ninth shows that skeleton disjointed and broken apart.

Contemporary commentators interpreted this print as a critique of the idle nobility, as well as a more general commentary on the importance of sight and hearing for human understanding. Observation and experience are inaccessible to these two figures; instead of using their eyes and ears, they passively accept ideas given to them by an embodiment of blind ignorance.

The two became close lifelong friends thereafter. Neel painted a portrait of Andrews and his first wife, Mary Ellen, in 1972, and then created this imposing lithograph of the artist in 1978. Andrews, who had an even grittier approach to figuration, later produced the larger-than-life <i>Portrait of Alice Neel</i> in 1987, three years after Neel’s death, bringing their mutual admiration full-circle.<br>
<br>
Neel, a white woman who came of age during the Great Depression and had a tumultuous personal life, got her start through commissions from the Works Progress Administration. Under recognized in her lifetime, Neel has more recently been celebrated as an inimitable portraitist, who painted friends, family, and neighbors of all colors with the same care and vigor. Writer and critic Hilton Als, who curated an exhibition of Neel’s Spanish Harlem portraits in 2017, wrote of Neel’s “ethos of inclusion,” arguing that her work, which makes her subjects visible without any ideological agenda, captures “the humanness embedded in subjects that people might classify as ‘different.’ ”"

<br.
This juxtaposition of violence and safety is in the format of an ex-voto, a religious offering given to a saint in gratitude for answering a prayer. The inclusion of the prayer card depicting Saint Martin of Porres, a Peruvian mixed-race saint, locates this offering in the hybrid spirituality of Latin American.<br>
<br>
 The prayer indicates that the divine favor has not been given. It exhorts the viewers to join in syncretic solidarity across spiritual cultures. Porres is asked to intervene between the Yoruba orishas and the Catholic church, which is embodied by the communion receiver’s purity of spirit. The vow becomes a promise to unite and free the third world from “democracy’s prisons,” using the power of intersectional union, words, and images to heal the wounds of colonialism."

Exploring sex, religion, and the limits of respectability, this scene of bestiality comes from a series in which dogs also parade and nail the human figure to a crucifix.

Unflinchingly devoted to cedar wood even after developing an allergy to it, Rydingsvard’s commitment to the material informs her work.

<br>
Goya frequently merges human and animal features in <i>Los Caprichos</i>. This reflects his interest in physiognomy, the theory that physical resemblances between humans and animals indicate human dispositions. Here, for example, the mane-like hair and paw-like hands of the constables place them somewhere between human and feline, signaling their predatory nature as they prepare to devour the defenseless bird-woman."

A few details highlight the artist’s combination of traditional and personal symbolism. The figure at the far right, rising from a cloud, is a soldier in antique Mongol armor, a symbol of protection. He holds a shield that reads “6 FEET” with a graphic of two separated people. The figure third from the right is covered with small people that represent worries and mental burdens, but the rabbit at the top is a Buddhist symbol of resolution.

Uuriintuya Dagvasambuu is a contemporary painter from Mongolia. She was trained at the Institute of Fine Arts at the Mongolian University of Arts and Culture in Mongol Zurag (“Mongolian Painting”). A “national style” of modern painting developed in the 20th century, Mongol Zurag is comparable to other national styles like Nihonga in Japan or Guohua in China, which combine elements of traditional and modern painting.<br>
<br>
Dagvasambuu’s paintings are often visionary works of disturbing beauty. The artist borrows conventional stylistic elements from Mongolian religious art, such as repeated, geometric decorative patterns, meticulous fine-lined details, flat pictorial space, and planes of color. She also adapts Buddhist and Mongolian symbolic motifs, but updates and combines them with elements and details from contemporary life. These seeming contradictions express a very personal symbolic vocabulary for the artist while also reflecting a shared global experience.

She was among the students of Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (1755– 1842), perhaps the best-known female artist at the end of the 18th century—when women painters were beginning to have more opportunities, though still woefully fewer than men. Here she depicts herself in front of her canvas, palette and brushes in hand. Her style of dress, straw hat, and gold hoop earrings—referred to as “à la créole,” a shape seen as emanating from European colonies— date the work to the early years of the French Revolution.<br>

Tables like the one here would have held pastels and artistic materials; the top level would likely have been used for items including oil paint, stored at the time in pig bladders, before metal tubes were invented around 1841. The precise meaning of her gesture towards the table is unclear—but she certainly draws our attention, proudly, to her tools.<br>

Afro-Caribbean textile artist Sonya Clark (b. 1967, Washington, D.C.) came across a fragment of this cloth in the Smithsonian’s collection and began to ask what it would mean to the psychology of this nation if the truce flag replaced the Confederate battle flag as the enduring symbol of the Civil War. Clark produced a monumental replica of the truce flag in 2019, which was acquired by the Smithsonian. Clark later produced this handmade paper version, <i>Confederate, Surrender</i>, with a publisher in Los Angeles. Clark has interrogated the Confederate battle flag in several pieces, including Unraveling, in which she invited audience members to deconstruct the Confederate battle flag thread by thread.<br>

Within the Allen’s collection, Clark’s work joins a doily painting by fellow Trinidadian artist Zak Ové, and other artists who combine textile, thread, and paper-making techniques such as Ambreen Butt, Ghada Amer, Willie Cole, Jean Shin, and Leslie Dill. The work also adds to flags and representations of flags in the Allen’s collection, including Haitian Vodou flags and depictions of the American flag in works by Peter Saul, Alexander Calder, and others. This piece will foster conversation around collective memory, monuments and memorialization, craft and fiber arts, as well as race, racism, and Civil War history. <br>

The standard practice in Western art museums is to photograph the objects in their collections as neutrally as possible, against a simple gradient backdrop, with even lighting, and no additional context. Edmonds’s photographs of African sculpture, replete with dramatic lighting and decorative backdrops, remind viewers that no presentation of African sculpture in a Western art museum can ever be neutral.<br>
<br>
<i>Young man wearing a maternity bust</i> features a Makonde (East African) fertility bust, which is similar to a Gelede (Yoruba) maternity bust in the Allen’s collection. Both are worn and danced in male societies to channel feminine wisdom and power. Edmonds—who is initiated into the Akan religion—connects these African and Black American contexts.

Xú has said, ""Other people all say I am a practitioner of contemporary art; in fact, what I have polished and refined are mostly obsolete things. These ""obsoletes"" contain within them the most fundamental things, core things. These old sayings that we have gone over again and again always have significance, always serve a purpose, just as if they are brand new things.""

Lê is a multifaceted artist who has produced sculpture, installation, and video works, but is perhaps best known for his photo-weaving technique, in which strips of photographs are woven together like a traditional Vietnamese straw floor mat. Born in Vietnam, Lê’s family immigrated to the United States when he was ten. He now lives and works primarily in Vietnam.<br>
<br>
<i>Russian Roulette</i> presents a literal interweaving of Lê’s relationship to the legacy of the Vietnam War, arising from memory, history, and popular culture. The brutal reality of the war is reflected in Eddie Adams’s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a South Vietnamese police chief executing a Viet Cong insurgent on a Saigon street, which acts as a large backdrop. Woven into it are frames from a scene in Michael Cimino’s film <i>The Deer Hunter</i>, in which an American soldier, captured by the Viet Cong, is forced to play Russian roulette.

In Persian art, the Buraq is often represented as seen here, with a woman’s face, a body like a horse, and beautiful wings.<br>
<br> 
The Buraq in Ala Ebtekar’s Ascension is flying in a sky filled with blue clouds and surrounded by falling bombs and missiles. She looks at us with a cryptic expression. The artist painted the work on pages from books of religious commentary, and some of the words leak through the imagery. How do you interpret this work? What do you think the Buraq’s expression suggests?<br>
<br>
Ala Ebtekar is a contemporary Iranian-American artist whose work draws from the traditions of Persian painting, but mixes in elements from American pop culture, such as comic book illustration and graffiti art.<br>
<br>
Born in Berkeley, California and deeply engaged with deejaying and hip-hop culture, he moved to Tehran, Iran when he was 19 to study painting. Beginning with traditional miniature painting, he shifted to a style of modern Iranian painting called ""coffeehouse painting"" (qahveh khanehei), rooted not in the elite literary world of miniature paintings, but in local popular culture."

Speaking to the complexity of identity and the wisdom contained within a body, the composition allows one to make associations without pinning down concrete meanings. Magic tricks, a seated Buddha, flora, fauna, and various renderings of snowflakes are among the signifiers that appear. The juxtaposition of pastel colors and a sepia-tone photograph suggests an anachronism, or an inversion of chronology, with the living subject presented in a more historical photographic medium than the inanimate objects that adorn it.

DiCenzo Fund for Japanese and Chinese Art,Japanese,,"In the early 1800s in Japan, many restrictions on domestic travel were lifted, leading to a boom in tourism and an interest in scenic sites and geography. One artistic reflection of this was the rise in landscape prints like Katsushika Hokusai’s famous series Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji. This fascinating charger, or large decorative plate, demonstrates an interest in the geography of Japan and its surroundings among the Japanese elites who could afford such artwork.<br>
<br>
The charger was made at an unidentified kiln in Arita on the island of Kyushu, where the techniques of porcelain production were introduced to Japan by Korean ceramicists. It was formed with a press mold, leaving low relief lines that indicate the borders of the domains of the period. The names of the domains, cities, and other decorative motifs were then added with cobalt oxide. The design is based on a traditional Japanese map type known as a Gyōki-zu 行基図. Some of the surrounding countries depicted are mythical, but in both its blue underglaze porcelain medium and map subject, this work makes a very clear connection to the development of global connections through trade and colonial/imperial spread in the early modern period.

The viewer is slightly elevated, giving us an overview of the setting. Subtle diagonals—in the line of figures and the break between the cotton field and sunflower field in the background—energize an otherwise tranquil scene. The serene, green cotton field that fills the composition is also enlivened by the group’s colorful clothing."

The AMAM collection contains two photographs by Namuth. One shows Pollock at work in his studio, and the other shows him with the artist Lee Krasner, his wife. The verso of the former photograph indicates that Pollock is at work on <i>Autumn Rhythm</i> and that One is hanging on the wall behind him. These are likely <i>Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)</i>, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and <i>One: Number 31, 1950</i>, in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The photograph offers a special glance into the gestation of two of the most famous paintings of the New York School, unstretched, and in progress. Pollock’s upper arm is tensile, while his wrist seems to grip the brush more loosely, suggesting the careful balance of chance and control, in the gradual build-up of layers and compositional deliberations.<br>

(19.1 × 24.1 cm),,Hedy Landman (OC 1953) Memorial Art Fund,,,"Lee Krasner (1908-1984, b. New York, NY) was an Abstract Expressionist painter. While studying art in 1935, Krasner joined the Works Progress Administration’s (WPA) Federal Art Project to support herself. Through her work with the WPA, she became a central figure in New York’s avant-garde artist circles, joining the Artists Union and the organization, American Abstract Artists. 

In 1942, Krasner met fellow Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock when they were both included in an exhibition of French and American painters organized by John Graham. The two moved to East Hampton, NY and married in 1945. In recent years, critics have credited Krasner for much of Pollock’s success, specifically through the introductions she made between him and her circle of artists, gallerists, and critics.

Despite Krasner’s technical innovations in the field of gestural abstraction and her idiosyncratic aesthetic, she was often overshadowed by her male contemporaries, especially Pollock. Some critics even blamed her for negatively impacting Pollock’s work. Posthumously, critics have come to reevaluate the pivotal role that her work played within the history of Abstract Expressionism, as evidenced in the 1985 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.<br>
<br>
When Pollock and Krasner lived together in the Hamptons, they worked in separate studio spaces–Krasner in an extra bedroom, and Pollock in a barn in the backyard. After Pollock died in 1956, Krasner moved her studio to the barn and began working on her largest series, the <i>Umber Paintings</i>, among others. In this photograph by Paul De Vries, we see Krasner in the studio, sitting in front of various paintings in progress, including the early stages of <i>The Sun Woman II</i>, completed in 1958, part of her <i>Earth Green</i> series. Printed ca. 1960-1961, this photograph offers an intimate view of the artist in a moment of introspection among her works and her poodle Ahab, named after Captain Ahad of Herman Melville’s <i>Moby Dick</i>.<br>

This portrait joins other works in the Allen’s collection by notable women abstract artists of Krasner’s generation, including Joan Mitchell, Helen Frankenthaler, and Eva Hesse. Alongside the Allen’s holdings of portraits of artists, this work will be of use in teaching by the studio art department, as it yields insights into a major artist’s working process."

Originating in China, the earliest landscapes were not concerned with representing a particular <i>place</i>, but in conveying an idealized vision of an artist’s <i>experience</i> of the natural world through carefully brushed lines and ink wash. These represented the forms and contours of rocks, trees, and waterways, and the absence of line and wash could suggest atmosphere and depth.<br>
<br>
Moon, known for clever cross-cultural and trans-historical combinations, has created a magical forest setting, with the blues and greens traditionally used to suggest otherworldly realms. The lion-like creature is a <i>haetae</i>, a mythical Buddhist protector. It carries a magical peach on its back, and peaches are spread around the space. In myths these peaches were found in the realm of the gods, and granted immortality. In art, they often hinted at human body parts such as breasts, cleavage, and bottoms. For Moon, they also connect to her sense of place as a long-time U.S. resident of Georgia, the ""Peach State."" Look closely at Moon’s landscape—disembodied eyes and rows of teeth hide among the rocks and clouds. What do you think the artist is suggesting with this sense of hidden danger in a seemingly traditional utopia?"

Exploring desire and a range of affects, her tableaux with raw meat are reminiscent of feminist body art and performance pieces such as Carolee Schneemann’s <i>Meat Joy</i> (1964). Susiraja claims her work is apolitical, serving as a blank canvas for viewers to draw their own conclusions.

Gibson has reimagined the handheld “whimsies” as monumental works. The phrase in the center, “Try a little tenderness,” comes from a song recorded in 1932 and covered by Soul artist Otis Redding in 1966. The beaded text at the bottom, “Born to be alive,” is the title of a 1979 Disco song by French singer Patrick Hernandez. Along with faces, snakes, and thunderbolts, a pinback button declares “Dirty air kills,” invoking environmental activism and the occupation of Indigenous territories.

(53.3 × 30.5 × 30.5 cm),,Purchased with funds from Carl Read Gerber (OC 1958) in honor of Driek (OC 1965) and Michael Zirinsky (OC 1964),American,,"Sahar Khoury (b. 1973 in Chicago, IL) lives and works in Oakland, CA. She was trained as an anthropologist and devoted the early part of her career to community-based research projects in Latinx migrant labor communities. Prior to pursuing formal artistic training, her art practice began in the context of her community-based work, in the late 1990s and 2000s in the Bay Area’s queer community, making works for concerts, performances, and protests. Khoury reflects on her years working with vulnerable populations, “Ethnography is a lot about observing the banal and the everyday and listening to it with a special sensitivity. I gravitate to the cheap and banal objects that are ubiquitous because I believe they have as much to tell me as a precious object in a vitrine in a museum. I am a strong believer that every object is political.<br>
<br>
“My natural inclination is to make unity out of unlikely materials,” Khoury explains. “I am more interested in points of unity rather than purity; purity just doesn’t exist in my worldview.” Although meticulously crafted and structurally sound, her work often appears improvisatory and makeshift, incorporating industrial materials and discarded objects, such as animal cages, bed frames, and leather belts. Her work has come to include mediums as disparate as ceramic , cast bronze , papier-mâché, textile, cement, and blown glass. Her sculptures allude obliquely to architectural forms, such as screens, towers, gates, windows, and arches, as well as to monuments, but depleted of their grandeur.<br>
<br>
<i>Untitled (red with belts)</i> typifies Khoury’s color palette of earth tones, reds, browns, and black, as well as her use of tightly tied and buckled leather belts to reinforce her constructions. The slabs and joints recall precedents in California ceramics, especially those of Peter Voulkos. The protruding elements in the metallic lower section can serve as handles for art handlers. The practical incorporation of pedestals, handles, hooks, and other utilitarian aspects into the work as formal elements is typical for Khoury. While serving to keep the individual parts of the sculpture fastened to one another, the taut belts also allude to fashion, design, and kink. In her work with these and other materials, such as pet cages, she describes how constraints can offer a sense of safety and survival but can also limit movement and freedom. For Khoury, these tensions and polarities relate both to the intimate realm of her own house pets and to the geopolitical histories and conflicts with which she is engaged.<br>
<br>
Khoury’s Iranian mother and Jordanian-Palestinian father both fled their homelands to settle in the U.S. References to Middle Eastern culture and politics enter into her work in abstract ways. For example, sculpted hunks of kabob meat, pita bread, and sumac flowers dangle from some sculptures, while others incorporate a vat of Palestinian olive oil with a submerged neon tube silhouette of a camel. She has produced sculpture with sound elements, including recordings of the call and response of Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum’s concerts. In some of her spindly ceramic sculptures, the parts are fastened together with cast bronze screw heads in the shape of falafel balls or dried limes, a staple of Persian cooking. Khoury sometimes incorporates numerals in cryptic sequences, which, when decoded, she explains, “mark nationality and memory formation in Iranian and Palestinian histories” such as 1948/1995 or 1953/1979. Other works bear the jumbled letters of deconstructed words such as “orientalism” and “colonial.”"

An older woman, possibly her grandmother, directs her. Knowledge, stories, faith and tradition are carried from one generation to the next.",Art Object Sales Fund,British,,"Although this work was painted in England towards the end of the 19th century, Alma-Tadema fabricates an intimate glimpse of a well-appointed 17th-century Dutch home. A young girl recounts biblical narratives illustrated on Delft tiles (a type of tin-glazed earthenware meant to imitate the appearance of hard-paste porcelain imported from China and Japan). In the background, the abandoned knitting needles draw a connection between women, craft, and the domestic sphere. The other decorative arts demonstrate an early-modern fascination with imported luxury objects.
 
While the rich details are masterfully rendered, this artwork romanticizes harmful rhetoric about the Dutch <i>Gouden Eeuw</i> (Golden Age), a period in which the Republic had a stronghold on the international trade of luxury goods, costly consumables, and enslaved people."

Sheet: 14 × 11 in. (35.6 × 27.9 cm)",,Ruth C. Roush Contemporary Art Fund,American,,"Loïs Mailou Jones was born and raised in Boston, studying at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. She worked briefly as a textile designer in New York and then as an instructor and founder of the art department at Palmer Memorial Institute in North Carolina in 1928. From 1930–1977 Jones taught at Howard University in Washington, D.C., mentoring notable African American artists, including David Driskell and Elizabeth Catlett.
<br>
<br>
Jones won the Corcoran Gallery’s Robert Woods Bliss prize for landscape painting in 1941, however she had to conceal her race and ask a friend to drop off the work for consideration, since the institution would not allow African American artists to enter the competition. Jones’s first of many trips to Paris was in 1937, where she spent a sabbatical year studying at the Académie Julian. In contrast to the racism she encountered in the U.S., Jones remarked that, “France gave me my stability, and it gave me the assurance that I was talented and that I should have a successful career.” This is when Jones began incorporating references to West African art into her paintings. In 1953 Jones married the Haitian graphic designer Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noël, with whom she traveled to Haiti annually. After the United States Information Agency asked her to serve as a cultural ambassador to Africa in 1970, she would travel regularly to Africa, visiting artists and museums, and lecturing in eleven countries.<br>
<br>
The impact of her travels throughout Africa and the Caribbean are apparent in work of the 1980s and 1990s, such as the Allen’s acrylic, <i>Symbols d'Afrique</i>. It was likely made in preparation for a larger painting, other examples of which are also based on a gridded structure, such as <i>Mère du Senegal</i> (1985) and <i>Initiation Liberia</i> (1983) in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC. In <i>Symbols d'Afrique</i>, a central column shows three figures involved in everyday chores, perhaps churning some liquid, grinding grain, and carrying vessels. The blue leaf in the lower left corner may be a nod to the cutouts of Henri Matisse, while the rooster on the right side references an important element of Haitian visual culture, in which roosters are revered and play a prominent role in vodou ceremony.<br>"

(20.3 × 28.9 × 3.2 cm)",,Purchased with funds from Carl Read Gerber (OC 1958) in honor of Clayton Koppes,American,,"<i>Self portrait as a trans woman soccer logo</i> is a miniature painting on the packaging of the artist’s hemophilia medication. In addition to the artist’s former name, “Ramiro Gomez,” other visible text fragments include “IV push 2 times,” referring to the intravenous mode of administering the drug, and “prevention of bleeding.” A silhouetted figure kicking a soccer ball is colored with the blue, pink, and white stripes of the transgender flag. The brooding brushwork in the background suggests a conscious act of omission or erasure.<br>
<br>
In addition to referencing Gomez’s own enthusiasm for sports, her self-representation as a soccer logo has special significance at Oberlin College. The National Collegiate Athletics Association named Oberlin the LGBTQ Institution of the Year in 2024, amid the passage of the Ohio legislature House Bill 68, which precludes tranagender women from participating in women’s college sports teams.<br>
<br>
This self-portrait comes from the first body of work that Gomez presented publicly following her transition from male to female. Other works from this series include paintings on the packaging of the artist’s estrogen medication, such as the double self-portrait, <i>My Past Self Painting My Present Self</i> (2024). Themes of reinvention and construction are apparent in these works documenting the artist’s gender transition as well as in her large-scale paintings and installations depicting overlooked immigrant laborers. The child of Mexican-born parents, Gomez knows intimately the feeling of being made invisible, as she was often cropped out of photos of the wealthy Los Angeles family for whom she nannied. As a trans woman and a person of color, Gomez highlights the ways in which visibility can be both a privilege and a liability."

Art in the late 1960s, Weiner is known for his installations of simple but philosophically rich phrases. Often incorporating puns and double entendres, his works are stenciled or applied in bold, block letters onto walls, floors, or other architectural surfaces. He considered the words themselves to be the work of art and, when installed, referred to the text-based installations as “sculpture.”"
